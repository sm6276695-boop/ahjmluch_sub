00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.224
Take it easy, Master Zhao.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.920
I'll entrust Zhao to you.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.480
Your Highness, what do you mean?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.880
Though I don't know His Highness's plan,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.920
I can't abandon him.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.880
Your scheme

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.800
never included him.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.600
Why do you

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960
act this way now?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
I've always been his blade.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.320
I should face this with him.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.304
Mother.

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:38.848
Go, go!

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.720
(He wants to protect you,
the young master,)

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600
(and this realm,)

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.480
(yet never himself.)

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.840
(These guards will serve him
with their lives.)

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.520
(Take them with you.)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.160
(You may break the siege for him.)

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:39.320
(Pei Ji, you liar.)

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.560
(You must wait for me.)

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.120
M-Mother.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.040
Stop crying.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.384
Watch closely.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.120
Let them

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.560
fight to the death.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.600
Only then can we

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.760
secure the throne.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.632
Kill him!

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.040
Kill him now!

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.960
Even if you leave here,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.280
you won't survive.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.640
I never planned to leave.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.360
Nor will you!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.176
Pei Ji! Pei Ji!

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.920
Xiyan.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.240
Xiyan!

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.360
Pei Ji!

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.280
The Western Army has fallen.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.160
Open the door.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.480
Don't come in!

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.880
Your Highness.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.200
By my command,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.800
no one

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.320
shall enter the main hall!

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.080
What are you doing?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.040
Pei Ji,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.400
what are you doing?

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.000
I want the people

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.920
to live in peace.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.280
I want the court

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.640
to be just and harmonious.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.720
I want this world

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.800
to know lasting tranquility.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.160
Pei Ji!

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.480
Pei Ji, open the door!

00:07:32.032 --> 00:07:33.320
P-Pei Ji!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.040
Prince Regent.

00:07:36.576 --> 00:07:37.504
You...

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.320
Don't kill me.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.880
Don't you want the throne?

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.960
I'll have His Majesty decree

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.160
t-to abdicate in your favor.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.600
When did I ever care

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.560
about the throne?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.560
Then what do you want?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.840
I'll give you everything.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.600
Everything!

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.840
Mother...

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.680
I can finally avenge you.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.280
Unless you die,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.640
my wife and child will never

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.840
be safe.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.880
Brother.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200
Mother.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.280
Pei Ji!

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.920
Pei Ji, open the door!

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.400
Pei Ji!

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.072
Pei Ji.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.640
Pei Ji!

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.320
Pei Ji!

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.560
Pei Ji.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.912
Pei Ji.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.576
Pei Ji.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.790
Summon the physician.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.976
Hurry, get the physician!

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.760
Why risk yourself alone?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.640
Didn't we agree

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.520
to wait at the villa

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.680
for your return

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.960
and you'll bring us home?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.440
So this is the moment

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.280
you finally show urgency.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.440
For me?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.440
We're both sorrowful souls.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.880
I understand

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.600
your burdens.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.840
At dusk,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.840
I'd often watch from the study window

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.880
as you sat

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.320
beneath Mandala blooms,

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:20.600
gazing at the waterside pavilion.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.520
Back then,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.800
did you ever think of me?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.960
I did.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.120
Thought about how to use me?

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.440
At first, yes.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.120
But later, not anymore.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.600
When did it change?

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.632
After you gave me
