WEBVTT

00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:02.977
You are assigned as an Accomplice.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.836
I saw you put your hand in your pocket,
doing nobody knows what.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.973
How dare you fool me, Benz?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.287
I’m just following the rules of the game.

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:10.807
You’re the spy, aren’t you?

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:12.152
Pie.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:14.725
The Detectives won.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.379
- Yes!
- Damn it!

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:16.755
You helped us win that game.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.499
I want everyone to see
that good side of you that I see, too.

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.171
I’m sorry,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.102
but I also want to play.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
I’m sorry,

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:39.500
but I also want to play.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.601
The second that dice hit the ground,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.600
I realized that...

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.305
there are still things
science can’t prove.

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:51.297
I used to believe that everything
can be proven by science.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.733
Observe, formulate a hypothesis,

00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:56.918
conduct an experiment, and gain knowledge.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.977
This is how you understand things
and get the correct answers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.170
FIRST PLACE WINNER
150,000 BAHT

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.290
GLASSES/FLUKE/CHEAT

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:10.711
Wow.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.404
Didn’t you win a hundred grand?

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:14.376
- You wouldn’t mind sharing it, would ya?
- Yeah, man, come on.

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:15.407
I don’t have it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960
You don’t?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Show us!

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680
What are you doing?

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:24.072
Nothing.

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:29.503
Are you alright?

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:55.650
What’s this?

00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:58.776
It’s a binary code.

00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:00.982
Each line refers to an English alphabet.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.860
When you put it together,
it spells my name.

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:05.260
Well, the first line is an N.

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:06.653
The next is A.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:08.002
Then, T.

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:09.299
- I see.
- D...

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:10.518
You’re Natdanai.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.320
You just represented our school
and won a competition, didn’t you?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.808
You’re so amazing.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.020
You were up against so many schools, too.

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:21.300
Science would explain
that the sensation occurred here

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:23.863
is a result of a release
of chemicals in the brain.

00:03:25.616 --> 00:03:31.008
But it still doesn’t help me understand
my own feelings that day.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.700
For the student president election,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.204
please present your student ID
in order to vote.

00:03:40.182 --> 00:03:43.102
Every student has one vote.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.079
STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT ELECTION

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.360
DO YOU WANT TO VOTE
FOR NUMBER 1?

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:49.167
Kaen.

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:50.505
Can I see the current results?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
Thanks, Kaen.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.180
Look.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.557
This can’t be right.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.169
40% MAI / 27.9% MAMAY

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.410
40.1% MAI

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.902
I’m going to the restroom.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.699
I–I voted for you, Mamay.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.820
It might seem like you’re falling behind
on the scoreboard,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.702
but I believe you’ll turn the table
and win at the end.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.703
Thank you, Kaen.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.360
CONGRATULATIONS,
THE NEW STUDENT PRESIDENT, MAMAY

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.127
You won!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.087
You won, Mamay!

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:41.819
Mamay.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.402
Are we… back in the game, Kaen?

00:05:53.272 --> 00:05:54.272
I’m sorry.

00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:56.404
If it wasn’t for me,

00:05:57.617 --> 00:05:59.980
you wouldn’t be back in this game.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.930
KAEN: MAMAY, HELP.
DON IS TAKING ME TO THE OLD GYMNASIUM.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.105
I have to go.

00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:06.602
Something came up.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.377
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:19.725
where all your desires will come true.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.050
We really are back in the game!

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.102
I’m not losing this time around, bud.

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.859
Why did you roll the dice?

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.342
I just want to know more about this game.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:38.835
Then play on your own.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.920
Why did you have to drag
other people along with you?

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.854
Why are you so mad at me?

00:06:43.142 --> 00:06:44.703
You said it yourself.

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:46.970
It’s all just a game.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.900
Unless there is something more to it.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.405
Please stop arguing, you guys.

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:00.407
We need to find a way out of this game.

00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:07.768
Guys.

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:09.114
Look.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.540
Does anyone else have their medal?

00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:19.400
Medal placement does not meet
the requirement.

00:08:21.274 --> 00:08:22.274
What does that mean?

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:27.802
I think our medals are different,

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:30.777
as you can see from
the difference in colors here.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.402
We might need to insert
medals of the same color.

00:08:36.955 --> 00:08:38.305
What will happen...

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.550
when it’s all one color?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.697
Do you remember what was said
at the beginning of the game?

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.305
The voice said, “the game of wits,

00:08:53.254 --> 00:08:55.705
where all your desires will come true.”

00:08:56.277 --> 00:08:58.097
“Where all your desires will come true.”

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:00.825
Do you believe in such a thing, Kaen?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.256
I mean, I know it’s unlikely…

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.762
But if this game really does grant wishes,

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:08.857
it seems like fun to play, doesn’t it?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.253
The only way to find out is to prove it.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.900
One thing is confirmed:

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:17.705
This game is real.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.108
But whether anything else is,

00:09:20.782 --> 00:09:22.422
we need to play ’til the end to find out.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.133
Let’s put our heads together
and complete this game.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360
Bold of you to say.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.510
You were the first to get eliminated
in the last game.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.402
Just don’t slow anyone down this time.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.136
All eight players, get ready for the game.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.802
Mark, isn’t this the school’s courtyard?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.151
There are some cards over here.

00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:42.890
The Skyscraping Stone Pillars.

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:46.899
Players are assigned as worshippers

00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:50.200
who are devoted to building
stone pillars to honor the Gods.

00:10:50.973 --> 00:10:55.143
Each player is given a “box”
representing a stone pillar,

00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:57.453
which is five squares in width.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:01.100
Players must bid for pieces
to fill their box

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:03.410
in an attempt to build
the tallest stone pillar.

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.500
So it’s an auction?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.109
Each player will receive an initial
of eight credits for bidding.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.875
There will be eight rounds of auction.

00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:17.392
Each round offers four pieces.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:22.170
These pieces are made up of 5-7 squares.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:27.801
Bidding will be done in a closed auction
in a private room.

00:11:28.297 --> 00:11:32.059
Players can access their private room
with the card they receive.

00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:35.506
Players’ credit history
will be saved on their card.

00:11:36.026 --> 00:11:38.770
When a piece is won from the bidding,

00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:42.201
players must add the piece
to their box from the top.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.586
Players can rotate the piece
to fit in the box.

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.280
It’s just like Tetris.

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:56.037
Pieces may exceed the box
on the left and right.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:01.259
The squares that exceed the box will be
put up for auction in the next round.

00:12:01.557 --> 00:12:05.694
One row is formed when all five squares
are filled horizontally.

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:10.004
Players must build three rows
to complete the game.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.604
The player with the most rows
wins the game.

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.445
At the end of all eight rounds of auction,

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.100
if there are players with
the same amount of rows,

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.002
the player with more squares wins.

00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:27.841
May the first round of auction begin.

00:12:31.943 --> 00:12:33.205
Did the game start already?

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:38.401
Before we begin…

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.800
Anyone understands any of that?

00:12:42.568 --> 00:12:43.857
I don’t get shit.

00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:47.202
Everyone must bid in an auction
for the pieces to fill their own box.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.004
Do you understand what an auction is?

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:55.379
Of course I do. I ain’t that stupid.

00:12:57.666 --> 00:12:58.666
What’s an auction?

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.650
You bid with money.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.204
The one with the highest bid wins.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420
Yeah.

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:08.777
So we just have to get
as many pieces as we can.

00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:10.604
It will be a competition.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.520
But each of us has limited credits.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.700
It’s going to be hard to win
as many pieces as possible.

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:19.564
Guys.

00:13:20.805 --> 00:13:23.979
I think I have a way
that we can all complete this game.

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:31.376
According to the rules, we need to build
at least three rows to complete the game.

00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:35.405
If we all agree which piece to bid for
before we start bidding,

00:13:36.422 --> 00:13:38.222
we can all probably complete it
easily enough.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.660
How would we do that?

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.530
There are eight rounds of auction.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.788
With four pieces for each round,
there will be 32 pieces in total.

00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:48.201
If we split it four times
between all of us,

00:13:48.472 --> 00:13:51.103
I believe we’ll all have enough pieces
to build three rows.

00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:53.402
It will also save us the credits.

00:13:54.631 --> 00:13:55.801
I agree with you, Mamay.

00:13:58.029 --> 00:14:02.371
From the pieces in the first round,
each piece contains 5-7 squares.

00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:05.773
That means there are at least 20 squares
in total in each round of auction.

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:08.705
To build three rows, we only need 15.

00:14:09.155 --> 00:14:10.850
So if we work together,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.105
everyone can complete it, like Mamay said.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.665
How can you be sure that

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.201
everyone will agree to rationing?

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.105
Why wouldn’t you?

00:14:21.619 --> 00:14:23.850
Everyone gets to complete the game
if we do this.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.659
But who will win?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.902
Yeah, he’s right.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.407
If the winner gets a medal
and get to make a wish,

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:32.602
I’d love to win.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.638
I can’t promise you will win,

00:14:36.237 --> 00:14:40.377
but at least this will allow everyone
to complete the game and leave.

00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:41.754
Prove it.

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:44.371
If you think your plan will work,

00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:46.382
don’t bid in the first round of auction.

00:14:46.737 --> 00:14:49.401
If you agree to that, I’ll do as you say.

00:14:53.251 --> 00:14:54.251
Deal.

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.401
I believe in your plan, Mamay.

00:15:03.266 --> 00:15:04.905
I won’t bid, either.

00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:36.402
You have successfully offered a bid.

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:45.702
First round of auction completed.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.502
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:16:58.647 --> 00:16:59.647
Yes!

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.265
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.998
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:14.800
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

00:17:18.023 --> 00:17:19.023
Hey!

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.245
Here are the players’ current credits:

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.558
Players, place the piece in your box.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.626
Kaen, look.

00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:02.600
What is that?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.241
I think it’s the piece
after adding it in the box.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.499
It’s color-coordinated,

00:18:08.026 --> 00:18:09.946
and in the order of
who’s leading the scoreboard.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.875
If it’s like this, we can estimate
what kind of pieces someone would need,

00:18:14.537 --> 00:18:15.798
and what they wouldn’t need.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.019
Hey.

00:18:25.325 --> 00:18:26.503
I’m taking the lead, guys.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.604
I’m getting back at him.

00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:38.557
May the second round of auction begin.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.303
Piece Number 6 was yours, wasn’t it?

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.780
Yes.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.530
It seems you know how to play
this game quite well.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.890
I listened to the rules of the game.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560
One more thing.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.509
You know how to play it
just as well as I do.

00:19:13.117 --> 00:19:14.117
Guys.

00:19:15.565 --> 00:19:17.508
Let’s try out my plan this time.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.401
If we work together,
we can definitely win this.

00:19:22.005 --> 00:19:27.699
Let’s let the people who didn’t get
any pieces in the last round choose first.

00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:29.029
Do you agree?

00:19:31.748 --> 00:19:32.670
I’m taking Piece Number 3.

00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:34.404
How come you get to be
the first to choose?

00:19:35.127 --> 00:19:36.621
There are three other people
who didn’t get any pieces.

00:19:36.645 --> 00:19:37.800
Come on, no fighting.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.054
Let’s let Don choose first, and then Pie.

00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:42.770
Kaen and I will go last.

00:19:43.802 --> 00:19:44.962
Which piece do you want, Pie?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.105
I choose Piece Number 1.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.799
You should take Piece Number 2, Mamay.

00:19:54.823 --> 00:19:56.007
I’ll pick Piece Number 5.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.460
Okay.

00:19:59.416 --> 00:20:02.103
I’ll choose Piece Number 2,
while Kaen Piece Number 5.

00:20:02.757 --> 00:20:04.376
That leaves us with…

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.179
Piece Numbers 4 and 6.

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:09.108
I’ll take a pass.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.031
I’ll keep my credits for the next round.

00:20:12.414 --> 00:20:13.703
I’ll choose Piece Number 4.

00:20:14.503 --> 00:20:15.503
I’m not bidding.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.080
You can take it.

00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:20.105
Then I’ll take Piece Number 6.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:21.937
That settles it.

00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:25.976
Only bid with one credit so you can save
the rest for the next rounds.

00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:27.776
Let’s do it.

00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:53.103
Second round of auction completed.

00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:55.511
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:20:59.628 --> 00:21:01.201
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:21:03.137 --> 00:21:04.702
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.102
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.210
It’s going according to plan.

00:21:13.802 --> 00:21:15.008
We can definitely win.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.377
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:26.851
Why are you doing this?

00:21:27.247 --> 00:21:30.004
We all agreed this piece
would go to Kaen!

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.456
It can’t be helped, can it?

00:21:31.579 --> 00:21:32.579
We’re in a game.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.352
Yeah.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.451
It’s an auction game.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.897
It’s totally normal
to place a bid, isn’t it?

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.257
There has been a tie bid.

00:21:41.386 --> 00:21:45.710
Players must offer a new bid openly
to decide who gets the piece.

00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:48.177
Bidding begins at 2 credits.

00:21:48.478 --> 00:21:50.900
Bidding starts now.

00:21:51.256 --> 00:21:52.256
Three!

00:21:53.783 --> 00:21:54.320
Four.

00:21:54.528 --> 00:21:55.004
Five.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.201
Your credits are not enough.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.602
The piece is sold at four credits.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.702
Bidding results for Piece Number 6:

00:22:14.168 --> 00:22:16.200
Here are the players’ current credits:

00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:21.804
Players who get credits
from selling their squares.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.940
Aom knew she would receive
her credits back

00:22:26.961 --> 00:22:28.300
so she placed a usually high bid.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.158
This isn’t just bidding.

00:22:30.441 --> 00:22:31.900
We need to manage our sales, too.

00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:36.985
It might be a good thing
that you lost that bidding.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.140
If you had won,

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.130
you wouldn’t have had any credits left
to bid in the next rounds.

00:22:41.697 --> 00:22:43.502
Benz now has only one credit.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.100
If you don’t cut your pieces
and sell them,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.180
you won’t have any credits
for the next rounds.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.096
Shit. He’s right.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.102
But more importantly,
we need to find you a piece, Kaen.

00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:58.402
Players, place the piece in your box.

00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:05.980
Just place the piece
in your box first for now, Mamay.

00:23:40.988 --> 00:23:44.201
May the third round of auction begin.

00:23:47.441 --> 00:23:49.890
Should we agree which piece to bid
before bidding this time?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.530
There are seven pieces,

00:23:53.022 --> 00:23:54.305
which is enough for all of us.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.453
Save for Benz who doesn’t have
any credits left.

00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:57.905
Just shut up, man.

00:23:57.954 --> 00:23:59.990
I’ll sell some pieces and
get my dough back in no time.

00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:03.503
You stole Kaen’s piece and
have the nerve to talk like this?

00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:05.208
How can you be so selfish?

00:24:05.714 --> 00:24:06.802
Selfish?

00:24:07.493 --> 00:24:08.802
It’s a competition.

00:24:09.197 --> 00:24:10.905
What you came up with is not fit for it.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.210
Am I right?

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.754
Who agrees with me?

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.308
I think Mamay’s plan works just fine.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.990
Don’t you want to win anymore, Don?

00:24:22.262 --> 00:24:25.202
Her plan allows us to get the pieces
we want with minimal credits.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.004
It’ll help us win
even more easily, won’t it?

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480
Fine, fine.

00:24:36.592 --> 00:24:38.109
I’ll do as Mamay says now.

00:24:38.592 --> 00:24:39.592
Alright?

00:24:50.927 --> 00:24:52.508
Third round of auction completed.

00:24:53.422 --> 00:24:55.002
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.614
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:25:05.548 --> 00:25:06.548
Don, you jerk!

00:25:07.032 --> 00:25:08.192
Why the hell did you do that?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.158
Didn’t we agree I’d get this piece?

00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.200
You stole the first piece from me.

00:25:13.494 --> 00:25:15.305
You said we can all win with your plan.

00:25:15.674 --> 00:25:17.242
Are you gonna let him cheat like that?

00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:20.802
You said it yourself that it’s typical
to place the highest bid in an auction.

00:25:22.364 --> 00:25:23.797
You made a mistake because
you’re a freaking moron.

00:25:23.802 --> 00:25:24.416
You bastard!

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.950
- Hey!
- What the hell you gon do!

00:25:26.894 --> 00:25:28.011
- You asshole!
- Come at me!

00:25:28.062 --> 00:25:28.757
You jerk!

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.368
Hey, hey!

00:25:29.438 --> 00:25:30.438
Stop it!

00:25:31.973 --> 00:25:32.561
Don.

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:34.200
Why did you do that?

00:25:34.355 --> 00:25:35.859
We all agreed to it.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.955
You said your plan would allow
everyone to build three rows,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.040
but you claimed
the best pieces for yourself.

00:25:43.845 --> 00:25:45.303
That’s not helping anyone!

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.948
But you each have one row already...

00:25:47.954 --> 00:25:49.300
Freaking stay out of this, Kaen!

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.490
You said it yourself. It’s a competition.

00:25:55.722 --> 00:25:56.306
Fine.

00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:57.665
Fine!

00:25:57.706 --> 00:25:58.746
If that’s how you wanna play.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.860
No more cooperating!

00:26:00.457 --> 00:26:01.176
Hold on!

00:26:01.447 --> 00:26:02.905
I’ve had enough with your plan!

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.900
I’m not doing it anymore.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.462
I think you should focus on building
your own three rows for now, Mamay.

00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:18.008
You can help other people later.

00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:19.908
I’ll help you, Mamay.

00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:21.597
I believe in you.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.757
I know everyone will, too.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.143
May the fourth round of auction begin.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.724
You have successfully offered a bid.

00:26:54.625 --> 00:26:57.912
May the fifth round of auction begin.

00:27:14.296 --> 00:27:16.256
You have successfully offered a bid.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.158
May the sixth round of auction begin.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:35.011
There are nine pieces this round?

00:27:38.663 --> 00:27:40.023
I think that could be good, Mamay.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.505
With more options,
you can build three rows faster.

00:27:46.546 --> 00:27:50.377
But if we cooperate, we can all have
one piece each without fighting.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.200
What do you want now?

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.670
You’re a lucky girl, aren’t you?

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.755
You have help in the game
and in the real world.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.721
What do you mean?

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.490
Kaen is always there to help you in
any kind of competition, isn’t he?

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.980
Aren’t you, Kaen?

00:28:11.552 --> 00:28:12.632
Let’s place our bids, Kaen.

00:28:31.155 --> 00:28:32.410
Took you long enough, jerk.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.456
You need to help me build three rows.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.555
If I refuse…

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.602
It’s not a request.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.170
It’s an order.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.942
If you refuse to do it,

00:28:53.634 --> 00:28:55.619
I’ll tell everyone what you did.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.764
It might seem like you’re falling behind
on the scoreboard,

00:28:59.788 --> 00:29:02.404
but I believe you’ll turn the table
and win at the end.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.379
Thank you, Kaen.

00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:50.226
Don.

00:29:50.302 --> 00:29:51.900
Mamay is taking the lead now.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.330
What should we do?

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.651
How is that possible?

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.690
Almost everyone in our class
voted for Mai, right?

00:29:58.056 --> 00:29:59.056
I don’t know.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.352
But if Mai loses,

00:30:01.988 --> 00:30:03.108
we’re ruined, man.

00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:11.992
I knew it!

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.908
I knew our effort wouldn’t go to waste!

00:30:15.408 --> 00:30:16.466
Good job!

00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:19.451
I think someone is messing with the votes.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.720
CONGRATULATIONS,
THE NEW STUDENT PRESIDENT, MAMAY

00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:27.441
You won!

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.502
You won, Mamay!

00:30:31.392 --> 00:30:33.100
Hey, there. Come with me.

00:30:34.408 --> 00:30:35.408
Stop moving.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.250
Stop moving!

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.059
What did you do with the votes?

00:30:44.648 --> 00:30:45.648
Huh?

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.054
You cost me so much money, you know that?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.265
What did I do? I didn’t do anything.

00:30:55.528 --> 00:30:56.528
Stop moving!

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.030
Now this is the evidence.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.186
I saw you put this thumbdrive
on the school’s computer,

00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:06.351
and suddenly all the votes went to Mamay.

00:31:07.557 --> 00:31:09.056
That’s obviously cheating, isn’t it?

00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:11.527
No.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.201
I…

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.558
I was just doing system maintenance.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.650
System maintenance?

00:31:17.317 --> 00:31:19.182
Like hell I’d believe that!

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.906
Now admit it, you jerk!

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.910
I bet I can find out if it was just
system maintenance or not.

00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:28.445
Everyone in this school will know
that bitch Mamay rigged the election.

00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:31.604
No. I did it on my own.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.503
Mamay has nothing to do with this.

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:34.605
Don’t tell the teachers.

00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:36.428
How about this?

00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:38.751
I have some money left
from the competition I won.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.157
I’ll give it to you for the bet you lost.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.770
Please don’t tell the teachers.

00:31:47.154 --> 00:31:48.154
What do you want?

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.054
I need Piece Number 2.

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.970
You need to negotiate it for me.

00:31:57.377 --> 00:31:59.102
Don’t forget I still have that video.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080
Samut.

00:32:06.322 --> 00:32:09.499
Can I talk to you about the auction?

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.703
What’s the matter?

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.300
I…

00:32:13.945 --> 00:32:15.850
I want Mamay to get
the piece that she wants.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.758
I thought I should come
and talk to you first

00:32:17.782 --> 00:32:19.222
so you don’t bid for the same piece.

00:32:21.908 --> 00:32:23.976
What if Mamay and I want
the same piece?

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240
How about this?

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.210
Let’s tell each other
the pieces we won’t bid for.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.552
You tell me two of yours

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.980
and I’ll tell you two of mine.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.657
You can decide the rest.

00:32:45.805 --> 00:32:46.805
Okay.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.254
I won’t bid for Piece Numbers 1 and 4.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.054
I won’t bid for Piece Numbers 3 and 6.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.404
What about Piece Number 2?

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.857
Is that the one you want?

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.640
Samut.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.604
Can you help me choose the pieces?

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.600
I’ll let you talk.

00:33:17.872 --> 00:33:18.872
Thanks.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.102
Sixth round of auction completed.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.051
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:33:34.872 --> 00:33:35.872
Yes!

00:33:40.506 --> 00:33:41.982
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:34:23.742 --> 00:34:25.222
Are you happy you completed the game?

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:28.099
None of your business.

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:30.650
Are you still mad at me
for rolling the dice?

00:34:31.807 --> 00:34:33.801
You saw it’s nothing
more than just a game.

00:34:34.438 --> 00:34:35.838
It’s not as dangerous as you think.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.730
You don’t know anything about this game
so you probably shouldn’t say anything.

00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:40.906
What should I know?

00:34:41.457 --> 00:34:42.457
Tell me.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.400
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.303
Even you?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.201
May the seventh round of auction begin.

00:35:12.706 --> 00:35:13.706
Hey.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.558
I need more credits for the next round.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.848
Buy the squares I’m auctioning off.

00:35:20.928 --> 00:35:21.928
You copy?

00:35:24.114 --> 00:35:25.645
I want Piece Number 2.

00:35:26.029 --> 00:35:27.706
You have three rows already.

00:35:28.262 --> 00:35:29.600
That’s enough to complete the game.

00:35:29.617 --> 00:35:30.902
I didn’t ask for your opinion.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.602
I need to be the best.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040
Samut.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.900
I’m not bidding for
Piece Numbers 3 and 5.

00:35:56.423 --> 00:35:58.302
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.710
Kaen.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.960
What you’re doing right now…

00:36:07.133 --> 00:36:08.700
Is Don making you do it?

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:11.357
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:36:23.749 --> 00:36:26.000
I can help you if you want me to.

00:36:29.662 --> 00:36:30.905
Don isn’t doing anything.

00:36:31.263 --> 00:36:32.500
I’m doing this for Mamay.

00:36:33.075 --> 00:36:34.906
She wants everyone
to get through the game.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.580
Okay.

00:36:45.093 --> 00:36:46.733
I’m not bidding
for Piece Numbers 1 and 2.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.096
Thanks.

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:57.859
Seventh round of auction completed.

00:36:58.272 --> 00:36:59.924
You’re definitely winning this thing, Don.

00:36:59.948 --> 00:37:01.503
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.051
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.853
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.300
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.057
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.099
Bidding results for Piece Number 6:

00:37:38.773 --> 00:37:40.505
Why didn’t you bid for a bigger piece?

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.580
You haven’t even gotten
three rows, have you?

00:37:43.174 --> 00:37:44.291
I…

00:37:44.648 --> 00:37:45.810
I wanted to help Benz.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.537
He had no more credits
for the next round.

00:37:49.499 --> 00:37:51.286
You want everyone to win
this game, don’t you?

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.980
Here are the players’ current credits:

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.154
Players, place the piece in your box.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.010
Let’s put the pieces in the boxes.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.260
Damn it, Don.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.742
May the last round of auction begin.

00:38:41.838 --> 00:38:42.838
Kaen.

00:38:45.408 --> 00:38:47.506
I cut my own pieces for you.

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:50.903
If you bid for it and win,
you’ll have three rows.

00:38:58.715 --> 00:39:00.201
I don’t have three rows right now.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.807
Help me out, Mamay.

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:03.905
Same here.

00:39:12.229 --> 00:39:13.229
Guys.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.200
Right now, Mark, Benz, and Kaen
don’t have three rows yet.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.230
I want you to help these three out
so we can all complete the game.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.991
If you have three rows already,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.966
I’m asking you not to offer
any biddings this time.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.400
I won’t, either.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.700
So the people who need the pieces
can have them.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.214
And why the hell should I do as you say?

00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:36.404
It’s for everyone.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.432
Your friend, Benz, will get
something from this, too...

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:39.900
But you get the most out of this.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.302
Aren’t we negotiating here
because you’re losing?

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.657
Do you always have to be so vile?

00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:45.801
And you!

00:39:46.157 --> 00:39:47.757
You said you wouldn’t cooperate anymore,

00:39:47.967 --> 00:39:49.767
but now that you’re losing,
you’re willing to?

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.506
Aren’t you doing the same thing...

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.090
by making Kaen to get you
the pieces that you wanted?

00:40:00.373 --> 00:40:03.004
I know you’re threatening him
with something

00:40:03.192 --> 00:40:05.032
so he would get you the pieces
that you wanted.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.783
You also made Kaen
buy the pieces Benz auctioned off.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.370
Don.

00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:16.106
Why did you do that?

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.183
You forced us to play this, and now
you forced him to do your bidding?

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.860
Once we get out of this game,
I’m reporting you to the teachers.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.746
To think you’re still acting like
you’re the student council president.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.303
You don’t have power here.

00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:29.659
The only person with power is the winner.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.001
And if Kaen didn’t help you,
you wouldn’t have been elected.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.601
You don’t know, do you,
that the only reason you won that election

00:40:49.019 --> 00:40:50.730
was because Kaen rigged it for you?

00:40:56.709 --> 00:40:57.709
That’s not true.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:58.555
You’re lying.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.300
I have a video of his confession.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.700
He begged and agreed to do
everything for me if I kept quiet.

00:41:04.552 --> 00:41:05.552
You wanna see it?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.834
Is it true, Kaen?

00:41:41.742 --> 00:41:42.742
Mamay!

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:44.870
I’m sorry.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.754
I’m sorry for all this.

00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:51.204
I did as Don said because I didn’t
want you to know about this.

00:41:55.562 --> 00:41:57.162
I’ll take responsibility for everything.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.202
This last round is the final showdown
between you and me.

00:42:43.656 --> 00:42:44.656
You, too.

00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:47.250
You’re pathetic.

00:42:47.681 --> 00:42:49.576
Do you want to win so badly
that you have to resort to this?

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.680
What’s the point of playing games
if not for victory?

00:43:32.368 --> 00:43:34.002
Last round of auction completed.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.801
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.503
There has been a tie bid.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.460
Why does it have to be you?

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.303
Bidding starts now.

00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:45.903
What will you do, Mark?

00:43:46.321 --> 00:43:47.900
Aom has four credits.

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:50.961
Three.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.640
Pass.

00:44:08.311 --> 00:44:09.311
Yes!

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:12.103
The piece is sold at three credits.

00:44:12.848 --> 00:44:14.401
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

00:44:16.257 --> 00:44:17.257
Yes!

00:44:20.437 --> 00:44:22.004
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

00:44:26.748 --> 00:44:28.259
I knew you’d bid for this.

00:44:28.728 --> 00:44:29.802
I ain’t letting you win.

00:44:35.248 --> 00:44:37.176
This piece might not give me five rows,

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.500
but it will still be enough to make me win.

00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:42.598
How would he win?

00:44:43.241 --> 00:44:45.207
He won’t have five rows.

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:49.837
According to the rules, if players
have the same amount of rows,

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.627
it’s decided with the amount of squares
that aren’t in the rows.

00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:54.400
The player with more squares wins.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:00.250
Good thing someone is stupid enough to
call a pass when she had a chance to win.

00:45:01.487 --> 00:45:03.287
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

00:45:15.805 --> 00:45:17.377
That means Mamay has five rows.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.807
But that means Kaen is…

00:45:39.785 --> 00:45:41.602
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:49.642
What the hell did you do?

00:45:49.677 --> 00:45:50.850
I’m just trying to win.

00:45:50.927 --> 00:45:51.980
Just like everyone has been doing.

00:45:51.998 --> 00:45:53.958
Don’t you know how dangerous
what you just did is?

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.902
There is a penalty for players
who fail to build three rows.

00:45:59.069 --> 00:46:00.893
Maybe the game will bring
someone out here to kill Kaen.

00:46:00.917 --> 00:46:02.137
How did it come to this?

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.216
Kaen wrote a program that would guarantee
Mai would lose the election.

00:46:05.231 --> 00:46:08.099
The suspect is be one of you.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.414
- You did this, didn’t you?
- Hey, hey.

00:46:10.514 --> 00:46:11.028
Didn’t you!

00:46:11.354 --> 00:46:13.204
The real bad guy is the person

00:46:13.727 --> 00:46:15.250
you’re all trying to protect.
