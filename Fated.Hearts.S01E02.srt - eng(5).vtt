00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.360
you must become

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.960
the bravest death warriors.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.440
Don't be afraid.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.020
It's all right now.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.720
I, Fu Yixiao,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.520
from this day on, join the Zhennan Army.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.670
[Nan]

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.870
I swear loyalty
unto death to His Highness.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.480
I shall tear apart those

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.720
who kill the people of Jinxiu,
and drink their blood.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.320
I shall execute those who slay
even one soldier of the Zhennan Army

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.240
without mercy!

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.550
Kill! Kill!

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.440
That's not how you looked before.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.050
Though there was anger,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.200
resentment,

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.480
your eyes held
more confusion than anything else.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.910
Looks like you've remembered

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.750
who you are.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.750
You earned great merit
in the Battle of Pingling,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.000
yet as a hero of Jinxiu,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.390
you ended up like this.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.860
What happened to you wasn't an accident.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.200
Someone in Jinxiu wants you dead.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.030
Who is it, and why?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.670
Do you truly not remember,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.910
or are you just unwilling to say?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.030
Fu Yixiao,

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.390
tell me everything you know.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.360
That's the only reason

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720
I've spared your life.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.910
Since you put it that way,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.630
I do recall

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.600
something else.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.720
Speak.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.080
47.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.630
What?

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.390
I'll take it back.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.080
You want to die?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.270
Let go of His Highness!

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.080
Your Highness!

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.940
Your Highness!

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.510
Kill her!

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.270
Avenge our fallen brothers!

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.030
Stop!

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:10.320
Your Highness!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.390
I said keep her alive!

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.270
The Battle of Pingling

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.440
was far more complicated than you think.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.840
She may be the only one

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.040
who can unravel the mystery behind it.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.550
And that mystery

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.790
concerns not only her life or death,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.630
but ours as well.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.850
[Prince Zhennan's Mansion]

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.240
Prince of Zhennan,
receive the imperial decree.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.150
By the mandate of Heaven,
His Majesty of Jinxiu

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.320
declares:

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.640
Out of care for the people of the world,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.030
I cannot bear to see the common folk

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.630
suffer further from war.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:58.360
Therefore,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.120
I have decided
to end the war with Susha Kingdom

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.440
and establish lasting diplomatic ties.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.840
I hereby bestow a marriage alliance

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.840
between Prince Zhennan
and the Princess of Susha.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.360
For the sake of the state above,
and the people below,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.390
this act reflects the curbing of my
paternal love and serves the greater good.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.790
Thus decreed.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.220
Your Highness.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.630
Your Highness, you're not thinking of
defying the imperial decree, are you?

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.490
Your Highness.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.710
I thank His Majesty for his great grace.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.670
Don't waste your energy.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.160
You might faint again from the pain.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.760
So I gave you some decoction.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.480
The numbness and weakness you feel

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.880
are just from the medicine.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.829
You won't die.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.510
What exactly do you want?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.960
To dress your wounds, of course.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.829
Otherwise,

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.569
you'll be left with scars.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.680
If you want to kill me, just do it.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.160
Why humiliate me?

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.920
I've never had a maid with me in the army.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.270
So if anyone's dressing your wounds,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.720
it'll have to be me.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.410
Shall I blindfold myself then?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.380
But if I blindfold myself,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.350
how can I help you properly?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.070
As a seasoned officer, Commander Fu,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.480
surely you're not

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.560
overly bothered by propriety.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.510
You might as well kill me.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.880
If I were you,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.200
in such a situation,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.000
I wouldn't seek death so easily.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.000
After all, death

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.310
is far too simple.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.550
Heaven has given you a second chance.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.310
You should treasure it.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.070
Better to just kill me.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.930
Don't think that by sparing me,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.480
I'll feel grateful.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.600
It took great resolve

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.750
not to kill you.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.590
I didn't spare you

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:28.920
to earn your gratitude.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.510
If you've got the strength,
then take a guess why.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.370
There's a reward if you're right.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.590
Has His Highness

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.340
ever personally dressed
anyone's wounds before?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.200
[Yun Fang, of the Feng Battalion
in Susha Kingdom]

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200
Never.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.880
So he never intended to kill her.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.480
Then why hit her so hard?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
How should I know?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.320
To avenge that arrow, maybe?

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.190
A bit petty, don't you think?

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.000
How dare you judge His Highness?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.200
His Highness's not usually

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.550
so small-minded.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.550
That's what I'm curious about.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.480
Wait, what are you saying exactly?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.230
Do you have nothing to do?

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.880
Why are you eavesdropping?

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.720
I...

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.720
Feng Suige didn't die.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.680
But my men

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.030
saw with their own eyes

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.790
his carriage fall off the cliff.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.000
How could he be alive?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.480
Feng Suige is cunning and elusive.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.940
He wouldn't die so easily.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.880
Even if he survived, so what?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.920
He doesn't know

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.120
I sent the assassins.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.510
Even if he suspects it,

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.440
without evidence,

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.960
what could he do to me?

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.920
He's Feng Suige, the Killer God.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.200
When has he ever needed a reason to kill?

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.920
I can't sit and wait.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.200
Ming, you must help me.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.830
Right now,

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.160
you've got no choice but to strike first.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.420
What do you mean, Ming?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.110
Before he comes for you,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.400
you go after him.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.780
He lost the battle.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.890
Someone has to answer for that.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.790
We may not be able

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.160
to touch Feng Suige,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.510
but his officers,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.720
his Feng Battalion,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.680
must pay for the defeat.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.790
In the Battle of Pingling,

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.550
they'd already broken
through Zhennan Pass,

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.480
yet they returned in utter defeat.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.000
His Majesty won't let it go,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and the court won't let it go either.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.610
Someone must be held accountable.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.380
There must be a scapegoat.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.920
As long as members of the Feng Battalion

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.350
fall into my hands,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.780
guilty or not, I can make them guilty.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.460
If he wants to save his men,

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.320
he'll have no choice
but to back down. Then...

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.050
The crisis is resolved.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.070
Brilliant, Ming!

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.310
I'll make him beg me

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.210
on his knees.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.000
[Post Station]

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.860
Your Highness,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.370
what are your plans

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.590
for Fu Yixiao?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.680
We set out tomorrow.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.200
She's coming with us to the capital.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.720
Your Highness,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.440
we're not returning to Qingye Camp?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.680
His Majesty hasn't summoned you.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.270
There's no need to rush back.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.750
I just think

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.920
if we go back now,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.640
some people will surely

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.510
make a big fuss

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.920
about the Battle of Pingling.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.480
This...

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.270
You forgot what day

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.550
the fifth is, didn't you?

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.640
Still so careless.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.160
I... I've been so busy

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.880
that I lost track of things.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.200
Quickly compile
the list of fallen soldiers

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.800
from the Battle of Pingling.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.830
Our brothers died for the nation,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.090
wrapped in horsehide.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.080
We must not
let their families feel abandoned.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.070
Gather the rations and pay.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.200
Distribute them household by household.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.510
The elderly, women, and children

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.160
who can't fend for themselves

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160
must be cared for

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.600
and given shelter and food.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.920
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.450
I'll handle it personally.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.720
[Susha]

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:33.960
If I were you,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.720
I wouldn't act rashly.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.960
You've lost your memory
and you're severely injured.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.240
You're no better than a cripple.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.070
If you resist,

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.600
you'll only hurt yourself.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.790
I didn't spare you out of kindness.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.190
I simply hope you'll surrender willingly.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.790
Enough nonsense.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.480
I wasn't the one who shot you

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.340
off that cliff.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.550
Nor did I send anyone

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.350
to kill you.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.920
Though you and I
come from different nations,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.880
and our hatred runs deep as the sea,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.550
right now, there is someone

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.610
who wants you dead even more than I do.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.110
That you ended up in my hands

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.790
may be the will of Heaven.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.480
I hope you'll
turn back before it's too late.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.030
But if you remain stubborn

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.240
and seek death with all your heart,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.040
I won't hesitate to use your life

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.110
to honor the countless soldiers

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.040
who died in the Battle of Pingling.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.880
Your life and death
are no longer up to me.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.030
They hinge on your own choice.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.240
Feng Suige,

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.410
I won't let you manipulate me.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.590
Don't even think about using me.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.030
Report!

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.640
Halt.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.130
Your Highness,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.760
the scouts ahead report that

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.000
His Majesty is hosting
the coming-of-age ceremony

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.640
for the Second Prince

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.300
along with all the ministers.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.270
Shall we return to the residence first

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.000
or head straight to the palace?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.880
To the palace.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.680
Yes, Your Highness.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.240
[Susha]

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.880
Those damn Zhuangs.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.720
Why did they have to
choose today for the ceremony?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.270
Lu Ke!

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.510
What is it?

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.680
I'm not afraid of being overheard.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.630
[Palace of Susha Kingdom]

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.100
Let the Prince take his place.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.270
Let the ewer be presented for washing.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.930
Let the black cloth cap be set
upon his head for the first crowning.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.030
[Feng Chengyang,
Second Prince of Susha Kingdom]

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.720
On an auspicious day of a blessed month,

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.580
you begin to wear your adult robe.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.120
Abandon childish ways,

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.000
follow the path of virtue,

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.480
live long and well,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.790
and receive Heaven's blessings.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.610
Next, the leather cap is bestowed.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.480
On this auspicious day,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.350
your fortune is reaffirmed.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.480
Respectful in manner,

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.510
refined in virtue,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:48.690
may you live a long and noble life,

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.880
and enjoy blessings forever.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.090
Third, the cap of nobility is conferred.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.160
According to proper season and month,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.680
your full adult garments

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.590
are donned.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.930
With brothers at your side,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.000
may your virtue be complete.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.530
May your days be unending,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.070
and Heaven grant you honor.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.310
The rite is complete!

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.260
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.550
Congratulations to the Second Prince.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.110
Rise.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.360
Let me take a look at you.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.270
We welcome the First Prince
back to the capital.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.390
The First Prince has spoken:

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.160
no need for formalities.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.070
Make way.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.440
Today,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.750
I'm afraid I can't give way.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.750
Until the truth is uncovered,

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.550
no one may enter the city.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.330
What did you say?

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.480
In the Battle of Pingling,

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.830
Susha was on the verge of victory,

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.000
but suddenly suffered
a strange and total defeat.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.400
The First Prince was even gravely wounded.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.550
Since the age

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.240
of 18

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.590
he's never lost a battle.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.160
He's Susha's Killer God.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.720
This sudden turn from victory to defeat

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.980
is highly suspicious.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.640
We cannot help but suspect

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.240
there is a traitor

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.550
among the First Prince's ranks.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.730
How dare you!

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.480
It seems

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.750
that you, the First Prince of Susha,

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.080
aren't faring too well.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.000
Imperial Guards, where are you?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.550
Here!

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.160
Arrest the members of the Feng Battalion.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.920
Yes!

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.830
Who dares?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.200
By order of the Prime Minister,

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.310
I am here to escort the Feng Battalion

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.770
to the Ministry of Justice
for questioning.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.200
Mr. Ma.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.700
It's the First Prince.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.220
Understood. Go ahead.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.720
Your Majesty,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.960
the First Prince and the Feng Battalion

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.020
have been stopped.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.030
If he can't even protect

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.360
his own Feng Battalion,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.960
he'll be at the mercy
of others once he returns.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.720
Let it be.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.640
The Prime Minister's order

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.480
is backed by the Empress's edict,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.610
and carries the intent of His Majesty.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.350
What now?

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.580
Does the First Prince
intend to defy a royal decree?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.400
Watch your words.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.230
His Highness will surely

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.040
explain himself to His Majesty.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.790
Move!

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.310
You're just a lieutenant.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.290
How dare you block my path?

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.590
If the First Prince won't hand them over,

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.320
then he's defying the Emperor.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.920
I am Deputy Commander
of the Feng Battalion.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.050
I know every person in this battalion.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.550
Let me go alone

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.080
to answer the questioning.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.440
You're out of your mind.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.350
It's all right.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.200
I'd like to hear

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.750
what they want to ask.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.510
Ask questions?

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.750
And after the questioning, will my men

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.010
from the Feng Battalion
be able to leave?

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.450
Commander Yun,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.960
this is too risky.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.610
Let me go in your place!

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.640
Let me go! Let me go!

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.830
Let me go!

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.780
I'll go! I'll go! Please let me go!

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.750
Please let me go!

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.310
Let me go! Let me go!

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.110
Everyone stop fighting.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.830
Let me go!

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.790
I'll go.

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.590
Mr. Cao.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.830
I joined the army at 20.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.510
First, I served His Majesty.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.070
Later,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.400
I joined
the First Prince's Feng Battalion.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.070
Within this unit,

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.400
I know every person's background

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.530
better than anyone.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.750
I've fought for 30 years.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.400
These old bones have

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.400
visited the gates of the underworld

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.070
more times than I can count.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.640
Going to the Ministry of Justice...

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.890
Is easier than a trip to the outhouse.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200
You young lads,

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.090
either full of fire,

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.720
or with families to care for,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.920
none of you fit the part of a traitor.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.920
Too complicated.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.790
But me, I'm alone,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.030
no family, no attachments.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.270
Most like a spy.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:38.350
So

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.880
I'll go.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.510
Cao...

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.440
Feng Battalion, hear my order!

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.160
Yes!

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.980
Remove your armor.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.960
Remove your armor!

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.550
Yes!

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.590
Veteran Cao Yuan

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.200
followed His Majesty 30 years ago

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.030
and led a thousand riders
to break into the Central Plains.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:32.880
He beheaded

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.510
five Western scouts with his own hands.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.970
In the Battle of Pingling,

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.750
he shielded me

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.680
from a fatal blow during the siege.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.030
The wound on his neck,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.920
if half an inch closer,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.580
and his head would've rolled.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.920
Call him a traitor?

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.230
Who would believe it?

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.510
I don't!

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.350
Hong Shan.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.000
Here!

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.480
Six times as a vanguard

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:57.170
death warrior,

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.160
he personally planted the Phoenix flag

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.400
on enemy walls.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.160
He was crushed by a 25-kilo boulder.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.550
To this day,

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.680
his left ear is deaf.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.000
Say he's a traitor?

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.830
Do you believe it?

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.070
I don't believe it!

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.160
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.370
I don't believe it!

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.770
What are you all doing?

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.570
Are you rebelling?

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.310
Take them all away!

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.880
Lord Zhuang!

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.540
Long time no see, Lord Zhuang.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:50.350
Your Highness!

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.220
Are you defying an imperial order today?

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.930
Let Lord Zhuang come forward.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.260
Speak with me up close.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.750
Step closer.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.720
Your Highness.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.700
I act under the Prime Minister's orders.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.640
Who?

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.470
Come closer and say it.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.030
I said

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.550
I act under the Prime Minister's orders.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.640
Choosing today...

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.850
Well, that's just bad luck for you.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.200
What do you mean?

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.200
A death anniversary deserves a sacrifice.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.920
You...

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.510
Then be the offering

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.070
for your godfather.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:22.110
Enter the city.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.960
[The streets of Yujing City,
Susha Kingdom]

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.800
I admit,

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.730
I was a bit harsh toward you before.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.630
Going forward, I hope

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.400
we can interact in a new way.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.760
Return to my residence to rest.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.719
Once your injuries have healed,

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.150
we can discuss in detail

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.680
how we might work together.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760
You want to work with me?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440
Don't you want to know

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.960
who shot you on the cliff

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.290
and who wanted you dead?

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.630
Back at Zhengnian Villa,

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.850
you were quite curious about that.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.500
Lu Ke, come with me.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.260
You, get someone
to look after Commander Fu.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.840
What, afraid I'll run?

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.190
Well?

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.320
Is it her?

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.280
Yes.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.190
So when do we strike?

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.110
Not yet.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.560
We wait for the right moment.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.670
Your Highness,

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.880
you can't go in!

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.410
Brother.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.360
Greetings, Father.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
You lost the battle,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.440
instead of reflecting at home

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.880
and waiting for my sommoning,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.550
you barged into the Chengde Hall.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.630
Today is my second brother's
coming-of-age ceremony.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.800
As his elder brother,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.730
if I didn't come,

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.400
wouldn't

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.880
people think

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.360
we're at odds?

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.630
Brother. You're back.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.630
Today isn't your birthday.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.480
Why hold

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.610
the ceremony today?

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.070
I don't know either.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.510
Mother chose the date.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.230
She said

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.880
today's a good day,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.270
perfect for a coming-of-age ceremony.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:28.440
Fine.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.800
Second Brother doesn't know

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.110
what today is.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.000
Father, do you not know either?

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.400
Today

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.800
is your second brother's coming-of-age.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.150
Then it's

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.890
has been chosen quite unfortunately.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.360
I have to

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.440
spoil

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.340
this ceremony,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.940
but will make it up to you another day.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.630
Oh,

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.440
I sent you a nice sword

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440
to your quarters.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.960
Go have a look.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.190
Really?

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.710
Thanks, Brother!

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.030
Father.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.070
Go on.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.370
I take my leave.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Since you're here,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.840
explain,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280
why did we lose

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.770
the Battle of Pingling?

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.110
Your Majesty,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.030
I suspect there's a spy

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.120
within the Feng Battalion.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.760
What evidence do you have?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.150
On His Highness's retreat,

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.590
he was ambushed multiple times.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.510
Had someone in the Feng Battalion

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.070
not leaked the route,

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.370
how could that happen?

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.840
If there was

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.230
a leak during retreat,

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.120
then perhaps the siege plan

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.150
was already betrayed

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.450
to Jinxiu beforehand.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.320
I've already sent Zhuang He,
the city gate official,

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.250
to take the Feng Battalion to the Ministry
of Justice for questioning.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.880
Do you have anything to say?

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.630
I think

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.630
what he says makes sense.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.000
However, I've already found

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.550
the spy in the army.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.630
Your Majesty,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.660
Lu Ke from the Feng Battalion
requests an audience.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.320
Summon him.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.230
I'm subordinate Lu Ke.
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.490
You're wearing armor.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.950
No need for formalities.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.910
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.830
Show this to the Prime Minister.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.070
He might

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.840
recognize this traitor.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.880
What's in the box?

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.550
Your Highness, do speak plainly.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.000
No need for riddles

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.570
before His Majesty.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.920
Since you don't wish to see it,

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.070
perhaps Vice Minister of Justice,
Zhuang Ming,

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.510
would be interested.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.880
It's... It's He...

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.360
Yes.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:23.510
Inside

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.440
is the severed head
of Zhuang He, the city gate official.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.670
He's the one who tried to assassinate me

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.280
along the way.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.190
When I entered the city earlier,

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.450
he confessed in person and was executed.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.400
He also claimed

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:37.150
he acted

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.840
alone.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.560
Your Majesty!

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.510
This is only the First Prince's word.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.070
There's no proof.
On what grounds was He killed?

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.670
I ask Your Majesty
to investigate thoroughly.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.280
What say you, Prime Minister?

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.960
Did I have reason to kill him?
