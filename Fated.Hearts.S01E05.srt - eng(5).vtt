[Episode 5]

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.000
Who in the royal family

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
hasn't endured grievances?

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.070
I know.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.090
This is my responsibility.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.930
Born into the royal family,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.950
everyone has their

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.880
own responsibilities to fulfill.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.690
But I just want to live for myself once,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.820
even if it's only once.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.910
Brother!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.120
Brother!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.950
Slow down.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.470
You're running so fast.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.270
If the governess sees you,
she'll scold you again.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.950
Brother, why did you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.470
suddenly come to the palace today?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470
Did you come specifically to see me?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.920
You seem troubled, Brother.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.400
I have something to tell you.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.430
I don't want you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.030
to hear it from someone else.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.230
What is it?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.630
Jinxiu has sent a letter
proposing a marriage alliance,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.290
seeking to form
such an alliance with our Susha.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.430
I'm here just to ease your worries.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.290
Don't worry.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.480
I will never

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.560
let you marry into Jinxiu,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.930
to Xia Jingshi.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.430
The Prince of Zhennan

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.350
and I are mortal foes.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.670
You're my sister.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.310
If you fell into his hands,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.240
you'd be doomed beyond salvation.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.800
I didn't argue with Father

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.400
in the imperial court today.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.620
But I will definitely find a way.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.310
No matter

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.390
what price I have to pay,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.850
even if it costs me my life,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.800
I will absolutely

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.240
prevent this from happening.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.360
Brother, no.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.470
-Actually, I...
-Don't be afraid, Xiyang.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.990
I was just joking!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.760
I've got a knack for surviving.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.720
Anyway,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.800
no matter what anyone tells you,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.090
don't take it to heart.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.320
If anyone tries to persuade you,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.880
tell them to come to me.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.220
Remember,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.900
as long as I'm here,

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.190
even Father

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.950
cannot force you.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.820
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.079
are you really planning to
marry Princess Xiyang

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.000
into Jinxiu?

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.240
In the First Prince's heart,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.170
Princess Xiyang

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.470
is probably the only family he has

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.410
in this world.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.870
The only family...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.420
Your Majesty, forgive me!

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.470
Even you think he feels nothing for me

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.030
but hatred?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.180
If that's the case,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.460
he must hold onto that hatred forever.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.600
Hatred keeps people resolute;

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.470
it hones away the weakness
in one's character.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.980
Is this really necessary, Your Majesty?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.040
He must overcome this obstacle.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.340
Only then will he be deemed qualified.

Your pulse is steady, nothing unusual.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.000
Strange.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.600
You were fine just now.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.260
Why did you suddenly pass out?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.000
I think it must be
the lingering aftereffect

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.070
from hitting my head.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.330
It's nothing serious.

I don't think they'll listen to me.

Whether they listen to you or not,

there's no way they'll survive.

Do you understand?

They came from

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.250
Should I send them back to Jinxiu,

or take them to Zhengnian Villa

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.480

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.850
Where are you going?

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.470
Shunzi!

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.680
Don't run!

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.270
Shunzi!

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.360
Brother! Sister!

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.160
-Stop!
-Fang!

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.330
-Stop!
-Don't run!

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.120
Brother!

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.910
Sister!

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.320
Eleven, watch over Nine.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.690
-I'll go after them.
-Sister, wait for me!

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.600
-Shunzi!
-Brother!

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.660
-Sister!
-Shunzi!

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.970
Your Highness,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.640
you've finally come out.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.360
Yun Fang

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.240
nearly drove me crazy.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.040
He insisted on returning to camp
to reorganize the troops,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.910
and bringing the Feng Battalion
into the city.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.170
What is he trying to do?

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.150
Stage a rebellion?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.320
Well, I talked to him.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.890
We only stopped him after discussion.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.890
That brat.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.070
Are you alright, Your Highness?

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.360
What's His Majesty's

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.840
attitude toward the marriage alliance?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.170
Whatever his attitude,

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.600
it won't happen anyway.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.810
You have a plan already?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.820
The undercover guards of Jinxiu
attacked Yujing

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.510
and severely wounded
the First Prince of Susha.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.480
The two states had just ended the war,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.860
and such a thing happened.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.320
Besides, it was the fault of Jinxiu.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.000
I'm sure they wouldn't dare
to go to war because of this.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.270
Brilliant, Your Highness!

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.960
You had us all so worried.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.030
We were so worried.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.220
I thought of it on the way just now.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.520
Impressive.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.200
It's impressive.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.700
Your Highness,

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.720
something's happened.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.040
Excuse me.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.700
I'm sorry.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.200
Master!

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.000
Master, please don't abandon me.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.990
I'll do anything you ask.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.120
Don't abandon me.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.150
I'll be good.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.960
Who told you to run off like that?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.790
Running around like this is dangerous.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.850
Do you understand?

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.480
Didn't I tell you

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.390
to listen to Xueying?

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.240
Why are you being so disobedient?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.370
What if you got lost?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.050
Are you asking for a spanking?

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.750
I...

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.150
Please don't abandon us.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.720
I'm not abandoning you.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.150
I want you

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.080
to leave Yujing City,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.510
and keep yourselves safe,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.240
understand?

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.120
Yixiao!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.120
Yixiao!

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.440
These kids...

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.000
They're so disobedient.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.180
I almost couldn't catch up with them.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.560
-Master!
-Slow down!

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.850
Why are you running around too?

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.670
You're all giving me headaches.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.300
Where's Fang?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.080
He's run off in that direction!

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.840
Fang went in another direction.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.240
They ran off separately.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.200
These two kids

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.720
have had me running ragged!

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.120
Yixiao, don't worry.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.410
I'll go after Fang now.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.480
I'll go find him.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.000
You keep an eye on

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.860
these two kids.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.730
No more running off!

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.480
Fang!

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.750
Fang!

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.040
Merchant ships on the Wei River.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.270
Fang!

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:14.980
Fang!

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.760
You're Fang, right?

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.500
Your full name is Qin Fang.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.550
Your father was once my squad leader.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.270
It's alright. Don't be afraid.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.320
As long as you behave,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.470
I won't hurt you.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.840
Alright.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.550
The time has finally come.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.680
We can make our move.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.350
Boatman, hurry!

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.240
Master!

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.390
Master!

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.310
Master!

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.180
They know this kid is my weakness.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.260
It seems that they know me well.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.350
You are from the Jinxiu Army.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.440
Master!

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.730
What's wrong, Commander Fu?

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.080
Don't tell me

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.890
you don't even remember me?

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.000
I've followed you for many years.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.520
I was even your guard.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.650
She fell from such a high cliff.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.610
Could she have damaged her brain?

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.360
Who wants to kill me?

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.480
Once you reach the underworld,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.390
someone will tell you.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.270
Move!

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.490
Master!

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.310
-Master.
-Fang.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.330
Are you okay?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.850
Master!

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.630
Master!

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.360
Master!

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.480
Master!

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.420
Master!

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.150
Fang!

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.500
Put down the knife,

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.710
or I'll kill him!

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.770
Master!

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.050
Don't worry about me!

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.800
Shut up!

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.270
Put it down!

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.200
Master, no!

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.590
Master!

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.240
Master!

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.640
Master!

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.140

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.030

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.960

Fu Yixiao!

This ship is soaked with oil.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.560
If you stay, you'll only die.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.550
Let me go!

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.950
Fu Yixiao, look at me!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.760
Fu Yixiao!

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.200
If you rush in recklessly

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.160
and lose your life,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.090
how will you ever get your revenge?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.260
Move!

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.860
I said move!

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.030
Let go!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.590
Let go of me!

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.480
Fine!

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.310
I'll help you!

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.290
All of you, go quickly!

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.060

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.000
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.860
Your Highness!

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.030
Fang!

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.310
Feng Suige.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.780
Where is Fu Yixiao?

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:05.580
Don't be afraid.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.640
Do you have the gift

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.270
I gave you?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.980
Do it now!

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.510
Your Highness!

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.410
Fang.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.240
Get in.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.100
Hold onto the box tightly.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.590
Come out when there's no water.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.320
Understand?

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.090
Master!

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.870
Master, I'm here!

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.480
Fang!

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.960
Master!

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.110
Fang!

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.550
Are you alright?

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.400
Where is Feng Suige?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.750
He's still in the cabin.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.550
Lie down.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.050

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.980
His Highness has ordered

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.350
that you cannot step outside the mansion.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.800
Who told you to lay hands on her?

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.510
It's all my fault.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880
It's all my fault.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.960

you would risk your life

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.850
Thank you for today.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.720
Rather than thanking me,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.270
you should be

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.520
apologizing to me.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.720
What do you mean?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.320

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.030
what did you do?

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.720
To save you,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.650
I pounded on your chest a few times.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.310
What?

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.990
Are you holding a grudge?

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.390
How can you forget

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.370
what just happened so quickly?

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.560
Why don't you remind me then?

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.070
I mean...

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.990
What more do you need me to say?

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.240
Are all women from Jinxiu

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.580

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.880
you are?

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.030
Oh, you're talking about that little thing

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.110
with the blowing?

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.910
How did you feel about it?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.750
Did you just ask me how I felt?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.880
I've always known

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.270
you're not an ordinary woman

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.400
and you don't care much

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.270
about gender boundaries.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.130
But I didn't expect you to be so...

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.400
So...

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.790
So what?

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.900
Never mind.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.960
Considering you did it

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.240
to save me,

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.880
I won't hold it against you.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.030
But you are not allowed

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.760
to mention this to anyone else.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.320
I can keep quiet about it,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.720
but I think

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.310
you should ask Fang about it.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.640
After all, it wasn't me who blew on you

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.200
just now.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.310
It was him.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.920
Master, let me do it.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.440
Stop laughing and put your shoes back on.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.510
Look at you!

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Wet shoes make feet uncomfortable.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.720
It's much more comfortable barefoot.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.920
You should take your shoes off too.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.720
Take them off.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.410
Alright. I can do it myself.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.960
Go ahead then.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.120
You just fell into water,

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:03.680
yet you're acting like

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.070
a sulking housewife.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.680
However,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.310
it's quite rare to see you like this.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.550
I'm indebted to you

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.570

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.750
even if it means
going through fire and water,

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.280
I will certainly repay you.

I know what you're thinking.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.590
You want to use someone from Jinxiu

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.040
to eliminate Feng Suige.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.050
Do you think you can hide it?

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.050
This is Yujing City.

Whatever you do,

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.680
do you think Feng Suige won't find out?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.320
I'm sorry.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.970
I was wrong.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.880
I have always been

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.830
completely loyal to you, Uncle,

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.880
and never had
any thoughts of disobedience.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.200
I just want to help you

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.310
solve your problems.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.000
Listen,

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.680
I have my own plans.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.510
Whoever dares to ruin my plans

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.570
will die by my hand!

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.370
Before Feng Suige tracks you down,

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.370
get out of here and hide yourself.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.240
Uncle.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.310
When can I return?

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.670
When I need you,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.540
I'll send for you.

Your Highness.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.240
The imperial decree was issued days ago.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.240
The marriage alliance
cannot be delayed any longer.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.950
We must set a wedding date soon.

[Uphold Virtue to Honor the Ancients]

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.520
We haven't even found Yixiao yet.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.440
How could His Highness be in the mood
for the marriage alliance?

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.240
I will keep sending people

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.350
to look for Yixiao.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.750
But this marriage alliance
is a major affair.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.010
If we delay any longer,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.510
and the Emperor blames us,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:05.960
we'll be...

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.760
We'll be what?

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.280
Would they really charge His Highness

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.760
with defying imperial orders?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.110
The one who guards the border for Jinxiu

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.000
is His Highness.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.230
The one who safeguards
the Emperor's security

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.429
is also His Highness.

But how does the Emperor
treat His Highness?

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:17.670
Withholding our military pay,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.130

Commander Fu...

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.360
Commander Fu is still alive.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.560
We've found her.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.510
You've found her?

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.170
What did you say?

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:38.510
Where did you find her?

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.250
Tell me.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.190
According to our wounded soldier,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.550
the Young Mistress of Zhengnian Villa

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.870
saved a woman in red,

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.100
who was Commander Fu.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.690
And Commander Fu was captured

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.170
by Feng Suige in the villa.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.449
We also learned that

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.550
she was taken to Susha by Feng Suige,

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.030
and is now in Yujing City.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.670
But we already went to Zhengnian Villa

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.530
to look for her.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.760
She must have been hidden then.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.950
That's great.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.540
Yixiao is still alive.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:06.730
I told you she couldn't possibly die.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.670
Your Highness,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.030
please let me go to Yujing to save her!

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.070
I'll even lay down my life

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.210
to get Yixiao back!

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.400
How?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.990
Will you go alone,

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.170
or take our brothers-in-arms?

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.550
-I...
-How many people?

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.710
Open confrontation or stealth?

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.440
What are your chances of success?

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.840
And you'll even lay down your life?

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.280
Does His Highness
not care about your life?

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.670
I just want to save Yixiao!

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.320
Enough!

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.320
Weiran.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.620
Send someone to inform His Majesty

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:31.710
[Uphold Virtue to Honor the Ancients]

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.590
that I will depart for Yujing immediately,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.360
and we'll discuss
the wedding date after I arrive.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.030
Your Highness,

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.760
I'm afraid it's inappropriate...

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.320
Go now!

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.510
Yixiao is in Feng Suige's hands.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.440
No one knows
how much suffering she has endured.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.230
Her life could be in danger

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.150
at any moment.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.670
Now I'm the only one who can save her.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.400
We can't waste a single moment.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.480
Prepare the horses,

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.670
travel light,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.070
we'll leave immediately.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:52.590
Yes.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.800
His Highness will be fine.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.210
He will be safe.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.070
Let's search downstream
along the riverbank.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.190
We must find His Highness.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.050
Your Highness!

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.220
Your Highness!

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.010
Your Highness!

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.080
Your Highness!

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:05.970
Your Highness!

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.150
Your Highness!

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.570
Yun Fang.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.880
Take some men to search the east bank.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.670
I'll check ahead.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.030
Okay.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.630
Wait!

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.030
Stop!

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.190
Listen.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.070
It's His Highness's secret signal.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.330
-Hurry! Go that way! Hurry!
-Over there.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.410
Will this really summon your men?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.510
My men should be

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.590
searching along the river

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.440
for any trace of me right now.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.030
Your Highness!

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.760
They shouldn't be too far away.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.960
That's true.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.820
You're the First Prince after all.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:53.960
They need to see you alive

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.880
or your body.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.640
What?

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.490
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.190
But

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.510
this really is

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.040
a perfect place for murder.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.150
Three taps followed by
a pause of one breath,

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:30.590
four taps followed by
a pause of three breaths,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.110
two taps followed by
a pause of two breaths,

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.510
repeat this cycle twice,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.560
then reverse the sequence once.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.630
That's your military's

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:38.160
distress signal, isn't it?

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.330
Knowing it won't help.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.630
This secret signal

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.160
changes every half a month.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.290
It's fine.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.760
Just tell me the new one

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.840
once it's updated.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.150
Sure.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.880
Really?

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.370
I dare to say it,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.560
but do you dare to believe it?

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.560
Guess whether I believe you or not?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.630
You said you wanted to repay my favor,

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.670
and now I've suddenly thought of

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.800
a way to repay it.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.710
Isn't that a bit too hasty?

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.000
It was you who just swore

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.480
and talked big

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.750
over there yourself.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.030
To me it sounds like

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.070
you're already preparing to back out.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:16.760
I, Fu Yixiao, always keep my word.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.690
If I can't deliver, you can kill me.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.710
Don't worry.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.630
It's easy to repay my favor.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.430
It's just a piece of cake for you.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.360
It seems you've long had this planned out.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.920
No wonder you're the First Prince.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.510
You have an ulterior motive
for everything,

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.510
and you'll never make a losing deal.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.800
Just tell me.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.960
Why are you getting so close?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.280
This is a secret.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.720
I was being foolish.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.150
There's no one else here.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.960
We don't need to whisper.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:16.740
Your Highness!

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.780
Your Highness!

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.150
Your Highness!

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.200
Your Highness!

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.430
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.550
Your Highness!

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.740
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:27.630
Your Highness!

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.590
Your Highness!

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.840
Your Highness!

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.550
Your Highness!

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.920
We can go now.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.420
How dare you fall asleep
right under my nose?

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.880
Aren't you afraid I'll harm you?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:18.920
What?

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.930
How much longer?

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.970
Your Highness.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.670
We're about to enter the city.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.130
We'll be back at the mansion
in just a moment.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.780
Tell Gu Yu and Yun Fang to go ahead.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.800
We'll circle the city a couple more times.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800
No rush to return.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.440
Yes.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:52.960
Fine,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.920
I'll let you rest a little longer,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.450
but don't make this a habit.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.750
How did I fall asleep?

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.590
Feng Suige,

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.740
why did you save Fang?

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.760
Aren't you supposed to be ruthless?

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.230
Why would you risk your life

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.360
to save a child

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.760
who means nothing to you?

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.590
Are you good or evil?

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.770
I find you more puzzling by the day.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.240
We've arrived, Your Highness.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.260
We've arrived.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.440
You fell asleep.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.490
Impossible.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.480
With strangers around,

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.230
I could never fall asleep.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.880
I was merely

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.150
resting my eyes.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.510
Master, where are we?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.230
It's alright now. We're safe.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.980
Let's go.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.560
She feels safe with me?

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.510
Brother.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.560
Thank you for saving me.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.070
Don't mention it.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.410
Didn't I tell you?

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.910
We're friends.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:45.000
You're the first friend

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.150
I've made here,

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:47.590
and in the future,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.320
if there's anything I can do for you,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.630
I'll definitely help.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.900
Great.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.750
If I need anything,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.120
I won't hesitate to ask.
