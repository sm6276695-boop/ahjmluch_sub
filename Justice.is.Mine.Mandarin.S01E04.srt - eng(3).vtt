00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.320
This piece of evidence is very important.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.680
I brought it here myself...

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.000
because I didn't want it to pass through other people.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800
When you get the lab results,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.280
you can only inform me.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
Hello?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.200
I know who hit Han Gang with a car.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Who are you?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
Who exactly are you?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.599
If Han Kui Long finds out...

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.480
that the one who hit his son with a car works for Qi Chang Rong,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.280
this matter will never settle down.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
It's the Old City Gang,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.160
someone who works for Qi Chang Rong.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080
Dad.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
Are you okay?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.000
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.000
(Episode 4)

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040
All right...

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.920
You're all so smart.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440
Use this to get some capsule toys.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.400
Go on, get some capsule toys to play with.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.240
You haven't been back for a long time.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560
Let's talk inside.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400
Mr. Qi.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.879
Ask Xiao Bei to bring two boxes of suckling pig.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.520
- Got it. - And chili sauce.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.640
Got it, Mr. Qi.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680
I still remember you like spicy food.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Mr. Qi, have some beer.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.480
Do you know why I asked you to come?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
I don't.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.080
Xiao Xue came to see me last night.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.520
She cried her eyes out.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.080
You should know about what happened to her son,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720
Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080
I've heard of it.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.040
Bao is the eldest son.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.520
Since his dad died,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
the whole family...

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.600
depends on him alone.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.240
Going to jail for stealing a car?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.720
It isn't worth it, no matter how you calculate it, right?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.599
Xiao Xue told me...

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.759
that the night Bao was arrested,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.320
someone called and asked him to go out.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.960
Do you know who it was?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.080
It was your husband, Cao Wei Er.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.640
Speaking of Wei,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.559
he was fired by the police,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.920
and he offended all the buddies.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.840
He can't survive on either side of the law.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.120
Can he support his family...

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.720
just by smuggling contraband cigarettes and appliances?

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.200
Our life is very simple.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.680
Food and shelter are enough.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.640
Mr. Qi, the suckling pig is here.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.600
Don't go out in the next few days if there's nothing special.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.040
Just stay at home.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960
Although you married an outsider,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.080
I still wish you happiness.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.880
But those who remain in the Old City District...

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.920
are my people.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.960
If anything happens to them,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.440
I can't ignore it.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040
Get in.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.920
You're from the Old City District?

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
Come.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.480
Come on.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.240
Come, this way.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.759
I'm Da Xiong,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
Big Fat Bear.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.840
With me around, no one would dare to touch you.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.080
I've got your back.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.640
Have a seat.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
What's your name?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.320
Bao.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.600
Bao?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480
Mr. Xiong.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.320
What did you do to get in here?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.079
I was working for Mr. Qi.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.240
Why are you asking so many questions?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.640
What about you?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.720
They said I stole a car.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.039
Stealing a car is a trivial matter.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.560
It's impossible for them not to let you out on bail.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400
Tell me the truth.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
Ma Shan Bao.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280
Your lawyer is here.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
Was Wei at home that night?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440
Yes.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.120
Bao went to see him?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.560
Sha Sha.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.719
I know you won't say anything...

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.400
that will harm your husband.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.880
But don't force me, Qi Chang Rong,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.760
to use your children as a reason.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.920
You get it, right?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.280
What did they talk about?

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.800
Do you know Han Kui Long?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
No.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.439
Everyone knows...

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.159
that Han Kui Long and I are enemies.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.280
It's only a matter of time before we fight.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.480
His eldest son is in the hospital now.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.840
The guy who hit him with a car is already in hiding.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.720
Everyone thinks the Old City Gang did it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
That's why the police...

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.320
thinks Bao did it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Hey.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.480
If Han Kui Long's son dies,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.920
Ma Shan Bao won't just be charged with car theft.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.440
It'll be murder.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.520
Your husband...

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.000
won't be able to get away from this either!

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
Bao.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.960
Do you want me to help you?

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.480
You're my client.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.840
If you want me to continue helping you,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.239
you have to tell your uncle...

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240
not to fire me.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.320
I want to see my mom.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.800
You can only see your lawyer for now.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.800
If we work together,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.640
I can try my best to help you apply for bail.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.440
Then you can go home and see your mom.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200
They...

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.480
They said besides car theft,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.840
I'm also involved in a traffic accident with serious injuries.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.400
Did they say who you hit with a car?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.319
Where? When?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.600
I didn't hit anyone with a car at all.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.080
According to police records,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.559
the car was stolen...

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.600
between 10 am and 12 pm.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.160
Where were you during that time?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.159
Why were you driving a stolen car...

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.240
when the police stopped you?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.720
Do you have your reasons?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.240
Or is someone stopping you from saying it?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.439
If a car accident caused...

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.999
serious bodily injury to someone,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.840
you'll be sentenced to at least five years.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.480
If you didn't steal the car...

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.960
and didn't hit anyone with it,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.120
where exactly were you during that time?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.600
I was in the Old City District.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800
Did anyone see you?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720
I was...

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.920
with my friend.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.160
What's his name?

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560
I need to find him,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.640
so I can get you an alibi.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.280
That way, you can go home.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.080
Can I really trust you?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080
His name is Xiao Bei.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.840
Back then, we were in the Old City District,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
stealing another car.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680
It was...

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.960
an old white Mercedes-Benz.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.200
It's rarely-seen in the Old City District.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.400
The police caught him that night.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920
But so far,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920
no news has been made public.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.200
Then pay them.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.920
Even if we're willing to pay,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.280
no one might dare to rat him out.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.840
I don't care.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.920
I want to know who this person is...

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280
and where he is hiding.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840
What are you doing?

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.440
I'm giving the patient an injection.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.320
The doctor said to give it to him every four hours.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680
Who are you?

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.880
You're not the nurse who was here before.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.200
The nurse who was here before is on leave.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.240
I was transferred from the Northern District.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.680
If there's a problem,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.400
you can ask the head nurse directly.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.080
May I give the injection now?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.000
I heard they're all gangsters.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.520
But they're quite handsome.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.239
It turns out they're a family of gangsters.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.920
- That's right. - It's scary.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.719
The blood on the asthma inhaler has been confirmed.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720
It's Han Gang's.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.639
Also, we got a few partial fingerprints from it.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640
We're still matching them.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.559
What about the saliva DNA on the inhaler?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.440
We're already testing it for you.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.999
A machine is a machine.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.119
The time is fixed.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.280
There's no point in rushing.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.600
All right. I'll give it to you as soon as possible.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.080
Thank you, senior.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
Inspector Tang.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.840
I have Ma Shan Bao's alibi.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.840
He didn't commit a hit-and-run.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
Let's hear it.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.720
Ma Shan Bao said that at the time of the accident,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.560
he was with a friend in the Old City District.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.000
This person can testify that he wasn't at the scene.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200
Ms. Zhou.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.080
Although Judge Qin trained you,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.279
when it comes to experience,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.280
you must accumulate it yourself.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.720
You can't learn it in class.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.640
Criminals with records like Ma Shan Bao...

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.839
heard some stories in prison,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.839
then claimed them as his own...

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.000
to get out of this.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.920
- And this so-called evidence... - Yes.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.079
has the time, place, and person.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.640
But who can it fool in the end?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.840
Maybe only you, Ms. Zhou.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.880
Just go to the Old City District to investigate.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.199
There's a stolen old white Mercedes.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.760
It's rarely-seen in the Old City District.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.439
As long as you find that car,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.519
I can give you Ma Shan Bao's alibi.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.639
Because of what you're saying,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.919
I have to search the entire Old City District...

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
for this car.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.399
Do you know how big the Old City District is?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.640
How many police officers must I mobilize?

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
If there's something suspicious,

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.960
the police should investigate it.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.360
Isn't that your job?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960
Yes.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600
We'll do it as soon as we can.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.320
When will that be?

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920
Ms. Zhou.

00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:20.039
This may be the only case you have.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.040
But what about us?

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240
Take a look.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.199
All the cases here...

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.679
are equally important to us.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680
Including yours.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
That's why I said...

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.800
we'll do it as soon as we can!

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560
Coach.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400
Where are you going?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.280
I've been suspended by the school.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.160
I'm already prepared for the worst.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640
I'm sorry.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.560
What's the use?

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.680
I'll go home now...

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.599
to beg my dad to explain everything to the school.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.720
Please don't.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.280
I still have to come back tomorrow to defend myself.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.080
I don't want to get into any more trouble.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.280
Hello. Is Xiao Bei here?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360
Who are you?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.120
I'm the lawyer of Ma Shan Bao, Xiao Bei's friend.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
My surname is Zhou.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.640
Hey.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
Who are you looking for?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.279
She's looking for Xiao Bei.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.960
She said she's Bao's lawyer.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yes.

00:17:06.001 --> 00:17:07.680
Ma Shan Bao needs Xiao Bei's help.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080
Help?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
What kind of help?

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.480
Isn't Bao arrested by the police?

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.960
That's it.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.399
I need Xiao Bei to tell me...

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.200
where the car he and Ma Shan Bao stole is.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360
What did you say?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360
Car theft?

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.080
Hey! What are you talking about?

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.639
You're a lawyer?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.240
You're obviously a cop!

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.679
- Mom, go inside first. - I'm not.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.680
Let me talk to Xiao Bei.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.160
Go inside and don't let Xiao Bei out.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320
Xiao Bei!

00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:31.200
- Ma Shan Bao needs your help. - Get lost!

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.239
Only you can help Ma Shan Bao!

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240
Get lost!

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.959
Xiao Bei, don't be afraid...

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960
I'm here.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240
Get lost!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.840
The police is here!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.320
Get lost!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.920
Don't let me see you again!

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240
Get lost!

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.680
You still won't leave?

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
Why are you sitting here?

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.080
Are you going...

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.640
to school tomorrow?

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.439
Don't worry about that.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.880
Just worry about yourself.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.800
What are you planning to tell the principal?

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120
Let's talk inside.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.079
Coach is innocent.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.759
She took my alcohol and didn't let me drink.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.040
She didn't drink with me.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.439
It was my fault, I'm sorry.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
It has nothing to do with her.

00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:43.880
What are you doing? Why are you so nervous?

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.960
Sit down. Sit down first, come on.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.439
Tell me what you want to say slowly.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440
Tell me.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.040
I shouldn't drink when I'm upset.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.280
I've already dragged you down.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.200
I don't want to implicate anyone else.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
I promise you.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.120
Tomorrow, I'll only listen to what Coach Yu wants to say.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.880
But I also want you to promise me.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.480
If you want to drink next time,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640
ask me to accompany you.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840
Okay?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560
Come on.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560
Pick up the stuff.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.079
That's right. I want to check the records.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.999
Was there an old white Mercedes...

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.519
reported stolen that day...

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520
or the day after?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.920
Yes...

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.640
That's it.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.760
Please let me know as soon as you have any news.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600
Okay, thank you.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.640
I'm sorry.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.239
I completely forgot.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.280
You completely forgot about me, right?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.800
Since you joined the Regional Crime Unit,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.800
you stood me up every time.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.800
I don't know how Mr. Shi can stand it.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.960
He always cancels on me too.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.440
I don't believe you.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.999
I'm not lying, it's true.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I don't want to talk to you.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.400
Don't be mad.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.480
Have you eaten?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.600
Of course I have.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.600
Hey, I can't get sick.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.119
I have to take care of patients at the hospital,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.680
then take care of you at home.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.280
Don't deny it.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840
Here.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360
What's this?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.439
Do you remember telling me...

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.880
the stomach medicine you're taking now isn't working?

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.520
I got you a new prescription.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800
I'm warning you.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.319
If you don't change...

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.680
these horrible lifestyle habits,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.240
it won't work no matter what you take.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.360
Hey, Ms. Tang, your shift is over.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.039
Stop treating me...

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.200
like one of your patients.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.080
You always scold me. Okay?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.000
I'm guessing you haven't eaten.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.680
Here.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040
I made porridge.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.600
It doesn't matter if it's good or not.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.160
The most important thing is that...

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.720
it's easy to digest and good for the stomach.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.760
I'm sure it's good if you made it.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.880
Of course.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.800
However,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.200
you've only been in the Northern District for two years.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.240
Why have you become even more of a nag?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.800
Be careful.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.080
You might not find any man who wants you.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.880
I think you're the only one I nag at.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.520
But I also think...

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.480
that after being away for two years,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.400
the Eastern District...

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.080
has really changed a lot.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.880
It's much more complicated.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.040
Which department are you in?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
ICU.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640
Intensive Care Unit.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480
Stay away...

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560
from those gangsters,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600
the Han family.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.480
I'm a nurse.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880
If I stay away from them,

00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:47.080
how can I work?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.040
Just listen to me.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.200
Don't get involved with them. Okay?

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600
Be careful.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880
Okay.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.120
I bought you breakfast.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880
Did I wake you?

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.560
I couldn't sleep all night.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.240
Our daughter cried again in the middle of the night?

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.040
I looked for you all day yesterday.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.960
Why didn't you call me back?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.800
I was out at sea to pick up some goods.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520
There was no signal.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680
I met Qi Chang Rong.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360
Why did you meet him?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.000
He asked me to meet him.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.960
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.160
Is he still pestering you?

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.920
You and I already have two kids.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.160
He still won't give up.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.120
Why do you keep thinking about this kind of nonsense?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.960
Then what is it about?

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.520
It's about Bao.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960
What did he say?

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320
Get out of the car!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560
Get out of the car!

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
Wei, what's the matter?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.160
Do you see me as a friend,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360
a buddy?

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.720
Can you put the gun down first?

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.400
You mentioned speeding.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.960
You're no different from those jerks!

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.400
To help you...

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.200
I still have two kids at home.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.959
Should I give you...

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.960
their lives too?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.919
Let me explain first, okay?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920
What do you want to explain?

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.760
You'll just keep lying!

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.760
You knew the car hit someone.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.279
You know who it hit.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.399
Why did you drag me into it?

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.080
I didn't want to drag you into it.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.840
Okay.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.000
You're pointing a gun at me now.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.240
Let me finish, okay?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400
Yes.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.160
My car hit someone.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.760
That's why I'm in so much trouble.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600
Wei.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.600
I'm sorry.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.760
I lied to you.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.760
Ever since that car hit someone,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.479
I can't remember how many people I've lied to...

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.720
and how many lies I've told.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.920
Because the one who drove and hit someone with a car...

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160
was Qin Yi Wei.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120
After that,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.480
I don't know why Bao's case...

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.400
ended up like this either.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.800
If you think I deserve to die now,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.600
it's reasonable for you to shoot me.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.199
Do you know...

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.599
who Yi Wei hit?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.600
I do, that's why I did so many things.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.200
I'm the one who sentenced Han Kui Long to prison.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.360
What if my son goes to jail too?

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.200
He won't even have any bones left.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.000
You have a son too.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.240
What would you do if you were me?

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.320
If you shoot now,

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.360
two people will die.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.600
You didn't have to be so cruel.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.400
I didn't even use any force.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.120
Does your wife know about this?

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.999
That night, it turns out that she saw Bao...

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
driving the car away.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400
Then will she...

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.640
tell Qi Chang Rong?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.720
She didn't say anything.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.360
What are we going to do now?

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
You're a dad.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.840
I'm a dad too.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.680
I have two kids.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Give me some time.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.680
I'll definitely figure something out.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.120
I won't let anything happen to the two kids.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.000
Mr. Qin, most of your funds are term deposits.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.400
If you withdraw them now,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.639
the handling fee will be very high.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.640
It's not worth it.

00:27:09.641 --> 00:27:10.920
But I really need the money.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.680
You also have a joint account with Qin Yi Wei.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.960
This is a current account.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120
You can withdraw the money freely.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.039
Okay. Withdraw the money from this account.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.040
I want cash.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.720
- Uncle. - Uncle.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.240
Is your mom home?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.160
- She's inside. - She's inside.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.319
- Son. - Uncle.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.240
Play with your sister. Go on.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.640
Yesterday, you said...

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.480
you would bail Bao out.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.199
Now, you're suddenly asking him to plead guilty.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.280
What exactly is going on?

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.400
I can't believe Bao is so unlucky this time.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.040
He's working for Qi Chang Rong...

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.760
under the Old City District's name.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.240
Now, he's taking all the blame.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.720
Whether he confesses or not,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.360
it's hard for Bao to get away with it now.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.000
What should we do then?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.720
The car owner came to see me.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.600
He said as long as Bao confesses,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.200
he can give you money...

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.920
that's enough to support you guys.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.440
Who...

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600
Who is he?

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680
Xiao Xue.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.839
If you really want what's best for the family,

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.880
don't ask so many questions.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.200
I promise the money...

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.720
will be delivered to you.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.079
I'll take care of you guys...

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.800
until Bao gets out of jail.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.520
But I can't let Bao suffer like this.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200
To be honest,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.959
it's not the first time...

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.000
Bao has stolen cars and stuff.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.799
When he grows up,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.800
in order to make money,

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.400
he might help Qi Chang Rong...

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.520
smuggle and sell drugs.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.840
He might end up...

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.000
in jail in the future too.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.480
It's better...

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.640
to use this time in jail...

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.320
as a chance to change fate.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400
With the money,

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.840
you can raise the other three kids well.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
With the money,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.160
Bao can start over when he gets out.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480
Most importantly,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760
with the money,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.160
you can leave the Old City District.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520
You have diabetes.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.360
You also need money for treatment.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.640
If you collapse too,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.160
what will happen to the three kids?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.720
How is the guy who got hit by the car now?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.240
He's still in the hospital.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.680
It was a simple car accident.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.680
Then do you know who he is?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.880
I don't.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.120
Hey, Judge Qin.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.039
I heard Judge Su...

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.320
is also on the list of Chief Justice Nomination.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.880
It's a pity.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.400
Recently, he was exposed for a cheating scandal.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.160
I heard he wants to drop out of the election.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.920
If that's true,

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.240
you and I will be the only ones left.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.480
A few days ago, I saw the police searching your car.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.080
You seemed quite nervous.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400
Is everything all right?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.239
That officer...

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.800
is quite close to you.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.960
She's so immature,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.119
doing this kind of thing...

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.440
at such a sensitive time.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240
Everyone...

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.240
has high expectations...

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.880
for the Chief Justice's character.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.960
I'll respect the court's decision.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.240
Sometimes, it's truly...

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.920
lonely at the top.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.440
I think a person should be steady.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.000
One should sit in his rightful place.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.600
That's the wise choice.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.560
Mr. Qi, Xiao Xue is here.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.960
Mr. Qi.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.240
Xiao Xue?

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560
Mr. Qi.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.000
Please help me.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.519
Please help me see Bao.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.600
They won't let me see him.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.079
Didn't he hire a lawyer?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.360
The lawyer can't do anything either.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.040
What about Wei?

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.640
He's Bao's uncle.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.240
He can't help you either?

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800
Mr. Qi.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.840
I'm begging you.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.440
Since we were neighbors before,

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560
help me.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.560
Okay?

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160
Mr. Qi.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.639
Bao is locked up in there.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.920
I'm so worried about him.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.240
Please help me, Mr. Qi.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120
Mr. Qi.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.720
I can't take it when women beg me.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240
All right.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.560
I have buddies in prison.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.360
I'll try my best to help you.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.800
When the time comes, remember to give him a tip.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360
I got it.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.880
Thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.719
- Bao. - Mom.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.480
- Bao... - Mom.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680
Mom.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.080
How did you get in?

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.120
I gave them some money.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.680
They're letting us talk for 10 minutes.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.960
Mom, where did you get the money?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520
Mom.

00:34:03.521 --> 00:34:05.480
- Mom. - Don't worry about the money.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600
But...

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280
Mom.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.000
It's okay. What is it you want to tell me?

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.680
- Mom. - I hope...

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880
you'll plead guilty.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.880
Think of it as helping the family.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080
Bao.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240
We have no power or influence.

00:34:30.241 --> 00:34:31.760
We can't fight them.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.159
We're not accepting the responsibility,

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.480
we're accepting our fate, Bao.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.879
When your dad passed away,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.000
he left nothing behind.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.600
I'm also sick.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.560
If you go to jail too,

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.759
how do you think...

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.040
this family will survive?

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.920
But if you're not going to jail...

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.240
for nothing,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.679
we can find a way for this family to survive,

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.680
a hope.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.320
Look.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.839
Your brother got first place this time.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.680
(Intelligent and studious, good in both literature and science)

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.160
His teacher told me...

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.079
he has a good chance of going...

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.320
to a better school.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.120
Your sister is the same.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.360
If we have money,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.520
my diabetes can be treated too.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.760
I can buy insulin.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.240
I've failed you, Bao.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.080
(Messages)

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.200
(Message: Bao has agreed)

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.119
(Hokong University)

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.840
Now, the head of the Academic Affairs Committee...

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.040
will tell us...

00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:45.199
about the result of our review...

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.200
and suggestions.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800
Coach Yu Xin...

00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:49.399
allowed students to drink alcohol in school,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.520
setting a very bad example.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.960
It goes against the principles...

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.440
of our university.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.760
The Academic Affairs Committee has decided...

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.679
to terminate the staff contract...

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.680
of Coach Yu Xin.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.520
Judge Qin, is our handling of this matter appropriate?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.080
Today, I'm only here as a parent.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.480
But I think...

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.240
we should hear Coach Yu's explanation first.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.320
Coach Yu, what do you have to say?

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.080
Let me repeat.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.439
As soon as I saw Qin Yi Wei drinking on campus,

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.839
I stopped him at once.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.640
- Did you drink with him then? - No.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.880
Why don't we...

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.760
listen to what the person involved has to say?

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.120
Coach didn't drink.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600
It was only me.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.400
As a teacher, shouldn't you have stopped him from drinking?

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.319
I took his bottle right away.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.320
Is that not stopping him?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.280
Should I have knocked him out before you can say I stopped him?

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.480
May I say something?

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.000
Go ahead, Judge Qin.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.360
Actually, I'm here...

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.360
to thank Coach Yu.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Because Qin Yi Wei...

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.600
suffers from severe asthma.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.520
If Coach Yu...

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.520
wasn't there when it happened,

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.880
he may already be in the ICU.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.400
As to how the school handles...

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.640
this matter,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.720
I will respect the school's decision.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.840
Judge Qin, please wait.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.760
Coach.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160
Wait for me in the car.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.400
What's the matter?

00:38:22.401 --> 00:38:23.799
I think you need to pay attention...

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.160
to Qin Yi Wei's mental state.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.479
It's normal for youngsters to drink and let off steam.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.880
But he had an asthma attack.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.120
Excuse me. Thank you for your concern.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360
My client...

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.879
has already stated many times...

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.559
that he has nothing to do...

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.800
with this recent hit-and-run case.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.440
But the police still detained my client...

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.439
for an extended period...

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440
even without solid evidence.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.240
This is completely unreasonable.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.320
It's obviously an abuse of the judicial process.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680
My client...

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.880
is innocent.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.480
Just because he's from the Old City District,

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.040
must he be treated differently?

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400
What did you find out?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.800
I found out the Detention Center.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.840
But I can't find his name.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.680
The police has sealed the information.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.440
I don't care.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.160
Someone has to pay...

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.920
for this.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.800
Two minutes at most.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120
All right.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.760
- Hello? - It's me.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.280
Mr. Qiang, what's up?

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.760
Take care of someone for me.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.160
I want him to wish he were dead.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400
Who is it?

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.440
An Old City Gang member.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.480
Don't worry.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.800
There won't be a problem, right?

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.800
I think so.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.800
Let's see if the heavens will leave us a way out.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.480
Work as a parking attendant with me after a couple of years.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.840
Don't do drugs again.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520
Bao.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.000
Why the long face?

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.080
What's wrong?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.800
Your mom came to see you?

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.200
Smile.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.880
Talk to me if you need anything.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.280
Life is never fair.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.760
Cheer up.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
You brat.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Fatso.
