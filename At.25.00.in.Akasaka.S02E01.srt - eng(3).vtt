00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.330
Good.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.460
Okay, next, let's get a profile shot.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.250
Yes.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.080
Great, just like that.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.750
Okay.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040
Look away.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.040
A bigger smile. Yes.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.880
So cute. Very good.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.790
Great.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.080
Try lowering your sunglasses a bit.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Perfect.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.790
Great work today.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.500
I'm so tired.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.210
Seriously.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.330
I'm exhausted.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.540
Shirasaki. He's cute, isn't he?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.500
He is.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.630
What do you like about him?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.790
His eyes.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.210
(Me, Him, and His Girlfriend)
I get it.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.790
He was amazing, right?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.960
- His last movie made me cry.
- I haven't seen it yet.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.040
Really? How was it?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.920
- You should watch it soon.
- I will.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.710
Look, isn't that Hayama Asami?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.210
It is.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.880
He's handsome no matter what.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670
Tell me about it.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.670
Hayama Asami.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.500
(Calling Eye)
"Premieres Tuesday, August 26th at 10 PM"

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.210
A popular model-turned-actor.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.540
And now, he's my...

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.080
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.170
He must.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.080
He's Hayama Asami, after all.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.830
True.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.330
Although... even I still can't quite believe it.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.630
Is he gorgeous?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.170
He's gorgeous.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.000
This star actor, Hayama Asami,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.170
is my...

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.750
You must be tired.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.540
Shirasaki.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.000
Asami-san.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.750
I'm home.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.500
My boyfriend.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.330
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 1)

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.790
Asami-san.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920
You should shower first...

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.250
No, I'll do it later.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.880
But don't you have to leave soon?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.580
Asami-san, what time is your call tomorrow?

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.290
Asami-san?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.540
Five.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.880
Five?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.040
- What is it?
- Wait...

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.170
I'm not stopping.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.790
But...

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.460
I gave in to my urges again.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.380
Do you want to win?

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.580
I'd like to win just once.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040
Is that so?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.790
Asami-san. Are you sure you don't want to
sleep a little before work?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.540
I'll sleep on standby at the studio. I'll be fine.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.920
Being an actor is tough.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040
You're one to talk, Shirasaki.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.210
I guess you're right.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.420
Have you read the script?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.040
I have.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.170
It's really good.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.960
I thought so too.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.710
I think it's fantastic.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.790
We get to act together again.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.710
Yeah.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.750
Well, I'm off.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.750
Asami-san.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.380
Be safe.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.540
I'm heading out.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.420
Good morning.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.830
Hayama?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.380
What's wrong?

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.830
Nothing.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.880
Just remembered something.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.790
I see.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.790
Akeno-san.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.250
You're not interested in me at all, are you?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.460
You could say that.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.540
As long as you do your job properly,
that's all that matters.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.710
Hayama-san.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.000
Let's do our best.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.210
Right.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.960
It's great that we're getting a sequel.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.830
It is.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.710
The first series was really well-received.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.130
I bet you'll start getting
commercial offers soon.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.960
Commercials?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.000
Shirasaki.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.710
Yes?

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.380
The real challenge starts now.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.790
Huh?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.130
It's hard to get famous.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.960
But it's even harder to stay famous.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.460
So let's work hard together.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.420
Let's give our all to every single job.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.000
Right.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.630
I can't forget.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.920
This industry is unforgiving.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.540
I have to...

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.920
I have to survive in this industry.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.380
So I can keep doing what I love most: acting.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.670
And also...

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.250
to catch up to Asami-san.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.580
I'm ready anytime.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.790
- Tomorrow or the day after is fine.
- Too slick.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.330
- Anytime.
- All right.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.920
Um, in this new installment,

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.000
we will depict the story of Ryoji and Takumi
after they got together in the previous series.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.080
(Will they become a couple, or break up?)

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.080
Then, we have Teppei, played by Sakuma-san,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.670
and Yamato, played by Yamase-san.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.920
A new love story will unfold between them...

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.130
I believe this is something many viewers
are looking forward to.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.380
Let's all come together

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.330
and work hard to live up to everyone's expectations.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.960
Let's create something wonderful together.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.920
Now, Director Kawada,
would you like to say a few words?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.080
Thanks to all of you,

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.830
we are able to film this sequel special.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:56.710
Thank you all very much.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.750
A love story that continues
after two people get together

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.960
is, in my opinion, quite difficult to portray.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.830
Because the most exciting part of the drama

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.040
is the moment they fall for each other.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040
However,

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.000
real love

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.210
doesn't end the moment they get together.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.170
After that, for both of them,

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.790
there are surely many more important moments to come.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.630
So this time, the story of Ryoji and Takumi
after they get together,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.630
as well as Teppei and Yamato,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.380
the love stories of these two couples,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.080
is something I hope to portray with care and nuance.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.580
Let's make a fantastic sequel together.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.080
I'm looking forward to working with you all.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.130
Looking forward to it.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.500
I'm so excited.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.710
I can't believe the four of us
are working together again.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.040
- Sakuma.
- Hm?

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.580
We're playing a couple this time.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:43.580
Looking forward to it.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.580
I'm still your senior, you know.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.460
You should show a little more respect.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.960
Right.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.210
But speaking of which,

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.710
I never thought you'd get this famous, Shirasaki.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.210
Hey, I worked my butt off
to get where I am.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.790
No, I get that, but...

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.210
- It just feels like you're drifting away from us.
- Give me that.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.880
It's kind of sad.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.330
What are you talking about?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.500
Aren't you more famous than me, Sakuma-san?

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.380
You were incredible in your last show.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.380
Shirasaki.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.750
- Let's get famous together!
- I'm telling you, you're already famous!

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880
I'm running to the convenience store.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.250
Sakuma, get me a soda while you're there.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.210
I told you, I'm your senior!

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:20.830
Huh?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.880
What do you mean, "Huh?" Don't push your luck.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.290
Do you two want anything?

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.790
- I'm good.
- Here.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.540
- Me neither.
- Got it.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.880
Okay, I'll be right back.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.040
Okay.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.380
Will we...

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.710
also have misunderstandings
or fights like Ryoji and Takumi?

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.420
Should we rehearse?

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.170
Just like we used to.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.880
No.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.380
No?

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.080
I don't want to.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.040
Okay.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.080
You're right.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.130
I'm looking forward to it,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.830
playing your lover.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.830
Hayama, it's time to go.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.170
Okay.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.790
Sorry, I'll talk to you later.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.130
Okay.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.630
Okay.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.630
Okay.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.040
Moving?

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.750
Your current apartment's

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.500
security is a bit of a concern.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.420
Not yet. Besides, I just renewed my lease.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.960
But we can't be too careful.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.670
- That's true.
- Let's just go together.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.290
But I doubt anyone would find out...

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.920
- Hey, wait.
- What's wrong?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.710
I think I've seen that guy before.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.540
Huh?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.790
- Huh?
- Right?

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.960
He's been in a TV show, hasn't he?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.580
I'm right, aren't I?

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.380
It'll be fine.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.920
I... I think so.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.380
I like you like this.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.710
The interview should be over around seven.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.580
If you'd like,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.460
do you want to come over?

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.790
The hit drama series, 'Daydream, ' was a huge sensation.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.630
And I hear you're filming a sequel now?

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.210
Yes, that's right.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.130
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.380
Thank you.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.040
We couldn't have done it without everyone's support.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.960
I'm truly honored.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.750
Thank you.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.830
And for my next question.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.880
What kind of role would you like to take on next?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.630
What kind of role...

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.540
Let's see...

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.000
Well...

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.250
there's a novel I love
called 'Rain and the Waning Moon.'

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.960
I'm... completely captivated by the main character.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.460
What is it about the character that draws you in?

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.790
His gentleness... and his cruelty.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.580
The protagonist embodies both of those qualities.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.380
That duality... feels so human.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.330
I can't help but wonder...

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.330
how I would portray that character.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.210
Here I come.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.500
Bring it on.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.880
Ready...

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.210
Go!

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.170
Here I go.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.420
Alright.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.380
It's delicious, but...

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.420
this is an interesting way to eat it.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.420
My family and I used to do this for fun
during summer break in elementary school.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.580
Oh, really?

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.500
It sounds like you have a fun family, Shirasaki.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.080
You're always so busy, Asami-san...

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.500
you probably haven't had a chance to enjoy summer.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.790
So I thought this might be nice.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.380
- Here.
- This is great.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.080
Wow, you're good at this.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.040
Here, have this one.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.250
Mmm, it's good.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.290
Mmm.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.580
It's hard for us to go on dates in public now.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.380
Especially since you've become so famous, Shirasaki.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.080
Actually...

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.790
I almost got recognized near my apartment today.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.420
What?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.250
Are you okay?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.540
They didn't find out where you live, did they?

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.080
I don't think so.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.710
I took off right away.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.880
And they didn't follow me.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.750
Let's get some sleep.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.540
What is it?

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.000
Not tired?

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.170
Didn't you say you wanted to
try resisting temptation for once?

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.080
Not tonight...

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.420
Tonight, I surrender.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.080
Seems like... we always end up losing, don't we?

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.000
Well, that's all your fault, Asami-san.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.380
Asami-san...

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.500
Have you ever dated a woman?

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.880
Never.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.710
Never?

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.880
For me...

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.290
I realized it back in middle school.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.920
That I'm gay.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.830
I see.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.580
What about you, Shirasaki?

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.500
I had a feeling back in college.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.210
That you might be the same way.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.460
I'd never been in love with anyone before.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.960
So I wasn't really sure.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.080
But...

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.130
now that I've fallen for you, Asami-san...

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.630
I guess that means I am.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.000
Are you heading out?

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.460
Yeah.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.920
Akeno-san is here to pick me up.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.420
Alright then...

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.170
I'm heading out.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.540
Asami-san, your phone.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.960
Oh, sorry. Thanks.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.210
Take care.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.630
Asami-san, what is it...?

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.880
Hayama?

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.330
(This is a work of fiction.)

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.540
(Next Episode)

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.580
Break up with Shirasaki.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.790
This is the worst possible time for a scandal.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.540
You understand that, don't you?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.540
She said we should break up.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.460
That it would affect both of our careers.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.210
I love you.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.380
I do.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.670
If you...

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.080
say this is a joke again, I swear I'll kill you.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.580
Let's break up.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.630
We're breaking up.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.210
This is for the best, for both of us.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.920
Thank you for everything.
