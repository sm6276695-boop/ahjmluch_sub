00:00:06.414 --> 00:00:08.014
If I get divorced,

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:10.613
I’ll be asking

00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:13.014
if you’d like to be with me.

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:14.213
You know that

00:00:14.213 --> 00:00:16.014
I’ve been waiting for you.

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:17.314
If one day,

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:19.314
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

00:00:19.314 --> 00:00:21.314
I must disappear, right?

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:23.314
Will you feel sad?

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.614
Loft, you’d better think about this carefully.

00:00:25.614 --> 00:00:28.213
Between the one she’s been waiting for for more than 3 years,

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:30.614
and the newcomer who she’s known for several months,

00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:32.514
whom is she going to choose?

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:39.413
Air,

00:00:39.413 --> 00:00:41.514
happy birthday!

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:42.514
Air.

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.514
Pure.

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:44.514
Pure.

00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:45.514
Pure.

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:47.014
Pure.

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.514
Stop doing this.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.014
If you do this again,

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:54.014
I won’t see you again.

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:58.014
Happy birthday to you!

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:05.014
Pure.

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:18.414
I’m right in front of the pub now.

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:19.214
Where are you?

00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:20.813
Loft, I can’t join you tonight.

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.714
Lila hasn’t slept.

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:24.514
My husband isn’t at home.

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:26.514
Why don’t you call me earlier?

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.514
Oh no! I’ve arrived.

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:30.014
Mommy, don’t turn off the light!

00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:32.813
Alright. Leave it on, then!

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:35.313
So enjoy your duty, Mommy.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:36.214
Alright. I’m here now.

00:01:36.214 --> 00:01:37.313
I’ll survive.

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:38.014
Talk to you later.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.514
Air!

00:01:39.514 --> 00:01:40.514
Air!

00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:43.014
Oops!

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:46.514
Air!

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:47.514
Hey!

00:01:47.514 --> 00:01:48.014
Hey!

00:01:51.514 --> 00:01:53.014
Hey!

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:57.014
Air, please be with me.

00:01:57.014 --> 00:01:58.014
Hey!

00:01:58.014 --> 00:01:59.014
Can you stay with me?

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:00.014
Hey!

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:01.014
Are you drunk?

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:02.014
Hey!

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:03.014
Hey!

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:04.014
Hey!

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:15.514
Air,

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:20.014
do you ever know how hard it is?

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:24.014
Though I’ve been in pain,

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:27.014
I’ve to tell myself I’m okay,

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:32.014
and I’ll survive.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:38.514
But it isn’t true.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:44.014
I don’t want to wait for you.

00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:48.014
I don’t know what I should do.

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:49.014
Well,

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:52.014
you don’t have to do anything.

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:53.514
If it’s right,

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:56.014
you don’t have to try that hard.

00:03:11.514 --> 00:03:12.514
Oh! You aren’t her.

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:13.514
I’m sorry.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:14.514
I’m okay.

00:03:14.514 --> 00:03:15.514
I’m alright.

00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:16.014
I’m okay.

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:16.514
I’m alright.

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:20.014
Please sit down.

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:23.514
Are you okay?

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:26.514
It’s okay to not be okay.

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:30.514
Don’t lie to yourself.

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.514
When you’re with me,

00:03:32.514 --> 00:03:34.014
you don’t need to act so strong

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.514
all the time.

00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:42.514
Look.

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:35.014
Let me be with you.

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:36.014
Loft,

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:38.014
what happened?

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:40.514
I just wanted to be beside you like this

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.514
until the end?

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:45.514
Loft.

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:49.014
I know well you still love Air.

00:04:49.014 --> 00:04:53.014
But I also love you.

00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:56.014
But being like this

00:04:56.014 --> 00:04:58.514
is good enough for me.

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:02.514
I mean it.

00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:21.014
Do you feel happy

00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:24.014
when you’re with me?

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:26.514
Yes.

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:32.514
What happened?

00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:34.014
I just

00:05:34.014 --> 00:05:36.514
thought

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.014
that

00:05:39.014 --> 00:05:43.014
if you went back to Air

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:46.014
how could I survive?

00:05:46.014 --> 00:05:49.014
Loft.

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:53.014
But you don’t have to feel guilty.

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:56.514
You haven’t done anything wrong.

00:05:56.514 --> 00:06:01.014
It’s okay that you don’t love me.

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:04.014
It’s my fault.

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:08.014
I put myself in this matter.

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:12.014
No one should be blamed.

00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:15.014
I’m …

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:18.014
I’m sorry.

00:06:58.014 --> 00:07:04.014
Tonight’s mine.

00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:06.014
I love you.

00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:07.514
I really love you.

00:08:17.514 --> 00:08:19.014
Hello.

00:08:19.014 --> 00:08:22.514
Aren’t you awake?

00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:24.514
Right.

00:08:24.514 --> 00:08:27.514
I went to bed late last night.

00:08:27.514 --> 00:08:29.514
I thought you’re at the studio.

00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:32.014
Can I see you at the condo?

00:08:32.014 --> 00:08:34.514
Now?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.014
I sent you some messages last night.

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:40.014
Haven’t you read them yet?

00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:43.514
If you’re busy, it’s okay.

00:08:43.514 --> 00:08:46.014
Well, I’m okay.

00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:46.813
Please come.

00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:52.014
Alright. I’ll be there in 30 minutes.

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:58.014
Alright.

00:08:58.014 --> 00:09:12.014
Loft,

00:09:12.014 --> 00:09:13.014
if Air sees us like this,

00:09:13.014 --> 00:09:15.014
things will go so big.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:45.014
Will we meet again?

00:09:55.014 --> 00:10:00.014
I don’t think I can handle it

00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:01.514
when both of you

00:10:01.514 --> 00:10:05.514
are together again.

00:10:20.014 --> 00:10:29.014
Loft.

00:11:14.014 --> 00:11:17.014
I don’t know what I should do.

00:11:17.014 --> 00:11:19.014
Well.

00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:23.514
Does Pure love you?

00:11:28.514 --> 00:11:30.514
Wanting a vibrant day?

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:33.514
Happy Sunday! Let every day be Happy Sunday!

00:11:54.015 --> 00:11:59.315
How did you get her so fast?

00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:02.614
I’m taking a shower first.

00:12:02.614 --> 00:12:06.114
Can you wait a minute?

00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:07.315
Okay.

00:12:07.315 --> 00:12:09.014
After you finish,

00:12:09.014 --> 00:12:10.614
please join eating.

00:12:10.614 --> 00:12:13.014
I’ve bought a lot of food here.

00:12:13.014 --> 00:12:15.514
Okay.

00:13:16.014 --> 00:13:18.415
Why did you

00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:20.615
allow me to use the painting of you for the exhibition opening?

00:13:20.615 --> 00:13:25.314
Because you’re the best at painting me.

00:13:52.314 --> 00:13:53.615
Oh!

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:55.715
This is a big meal.

00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:59.615
I thought you just had a quick visit.

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:02.715
I miss you.

00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:06.115
So do I.

00:14:06.115 --> 00:14:10.015
I’ve missed you

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:13.115
always.

00:14:13.115 --> 00:14:16.015
Until that person came in, right?

00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:28.414
You know? You’re not good at hiding your feelings at all.

00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:37.715
Will you choose that person?

00:14:37.715 --> 00:14:41.414
If you make a decision,

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.015
it’s the end.

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:52.914
Just choose it.

00:14:55.914 --> 00:14:58.914
I respect your decision.

00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:05.715
If it’s that easy,
37
I won’t be in this situation.

00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:26.914
Come on!

00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:27.914
You

00:15:27.914 --> 00:15:30.914
wear the same perfume as Air’s.

00:15:30.914 --> 00:15:32.615
Really?

00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:37.215
How can I fall for this kind or person?

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:39.215
Will you hug me?

00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:41.314
How do you know what I want?

00:15:41.314 --> 00:15:43.715
You’re so good.

00:15:46.215 --> 00:15:46.914
Pure!

00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:48.715
You can order more of it.

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:52.414
Oh! You stole mine!

00:15:52.414 --> 00:15:54.315
If one day,

00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:56.914
Air and Lamp are divorcing,

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:59.914
I must disappear, right?

00:15:59.914 --> 00:16:05.114
Will you feel sad?

00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:07.015
Loft.

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.215
Are you thinking about Pure?

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:27.114
What should I do?

00:16:27.114 --> 00:16:33.215
You’ve loved Air for a long time.

00:16:33.215 --> 00:16:37.015
But she hasn’t.

00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:42.015
That’s it.

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:44.114
And,

00:16:44.114 --> 00:16:46.914
does Pure love you?

00:16:46.914 --> 00:16:49.914
I don’t know.

00:16:49.914 --> 00:16:52.215
I’ve never asked her.

00:16:52.215 --> 00:16:54.515
I don’t dare.

00:16:54.515 --> 00:16:57.715
I’m afraid of the answer.

00:16:57.715 --> 00:17:00.215
And she’s never said that.

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:11.715
If someone we love

00:17:11.715 --> 00:17:14.914
has never been happy at all,

00:17:14.914 --> 00:17:18.215
how can we become happy?

00:17:18.215 --> 00:17:22.715
Thought I’ve been told to keep fighting,

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:25.114
The point is fighting with whom.

00:17:25.114 --> 00:17:28.715
We must only

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:29.914
look for someone

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:33.114
that we’re happy to be with the most.

00:17:33.114 --> 00:17:39.015
But for Air,

00:17:39.015 --> 00:17:40.914
there’s only one person

00:17:43.914 --> 00:17:46.215
that can be her happiness,

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:52.914
and it’s the same one bringing me happiness.

00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:54.215
Don’t tell Dad or Mom about this.

00:17:54.215 --> 00:17:55.914
Don’t let them know that I’m heartbroken.

00:17:55.914 --> 00:17:59.414
I’ll get well soon.

00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:02.414
Are you sure?

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.715
Not too long.

00:18:31.715 --> 00:18:33.914
What are you thinking about?

00:18:37.914 --> 00:18:43.914
Why do I have to choose?

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.414
If you don’t choose,

00:18:46.414 --> 00:18:50.215
how can we get to the end?

00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:54.015
We can’t be in a triangle relationship.

00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:56.715
Or you want it to be like this?

00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:57.914
Are you crazy?

00:18:57.914 --> 00:18:58.715
Yes,

00:18:58.715 --> 00:19:01.315
it’s crazy.

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.114
It’s the reason

00:19:03.114 --> 00:19:06.215
why you must choose.

00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:08.914
How should I choose?

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:12.614
Can you tell me, then?

00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:14.914
It’s not easy to choose.

00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:18.515
You’ve known this well.

00:19:25.515 --> 00:19:28.215
I don’t know.

00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:33.015
I’ve never had to choose between you and anyone else.

00:19:33.015 --> 00:19:34.414
Who exactly brought me

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:37.715
into this situation?

00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:40.715
If you had chosen me that day,

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:44.914
and hadn’t chosen to marry another guy,

00:19:44.914 --> 00:19:49.914
would we have been in this hard situation?

00:19:51.914 --> 00:19:54.114
Tell me, please.

00:19:54.114 --> 00:19:56.715
What should I do?

00:19:56.715 --> 00:20:03.715
Or I’ve to choose you?

00:20:03.715 --> 00:20:06.415
Even I wanted to be your choice,

00:20:15.415 --> 00:20:18.114
I’d rather want you to be happy.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:27.915
You know well

00:20:27.915 --> 00:20:33.415
how do you feel about that person.

00:20:33.415 --> 00:20:38.315
She’s in

00:20:38.315 --> 00:20:41.915
the painting there, right?

00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:46.014
Air!

00:20:46.014 --> 00:20:49.915
Am I right?

00:20:53.915 --> 00:20:57.915
You’ve already chosen, actually.

00:20:57.915 --> 00:20:58.915
You also know

00:20:58.915 --> 00:21:04.114
your true feelings.

00:21:04.114 --> 00:21:06.415
Don’t forget to let her know.

00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:08.915
Do you get it?

00:21:08.915 --> 00:21:11.715
I’m sorry.

00:21:11.715 --> 00:21:15.114
It’s okay.

00:21:15.114 --> 00:21:16.514
It’s okay, Pure.

00:21:16.514 --> 00:21:18.915
You don’t need to cry.

00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:21.514
You’re the best.

00:21:45.514 --> 00:21:46.715
Hello, Pure.

00:22:09.915 --> 00:22:11.215
Loft.

00:22:18.915 --> 00:22:21.715
Please let me be here with you.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:25.014
What happened, Loft?

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:29.014
Air,

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:30.915
please tell me.

00:22:30.915 --> 00:22:32.215
Air!

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:34.215
Air!

00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:36.215
I’m the first for you, aren’t I?

00:22:36.715 --> 00:22:38.114
Pure,

00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:40.415
I’ve made a decision.

00:22:40.415 --> 00:22:43.014
No!

00:22:43.014 --> 00:22:46.415
Air!

00:23:26.415 --> 00:23:28.114
Tell them you’ve changed your mind, now!

00:23:28.114 --> 00:23:31.114
Tell them you don’t want to divorce.

00:23:31.114 --> 00:23:33.315
Why do I have to do that?

00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:34.014
Because I told you to do so.

00:23:34.014 --> 00:23:37.014
Can you stop directing me.

00:24:07.256 --> 00:24:07.855
Oh!

00:24:07.855 --> 00:24:09.456
You came back?

00:24:09.456 --> 00:24:11.256
Did you eat anything?

00:24:11.256 --> 00:24:12.256
Umm.

00:24:12.256 --> 00:24:14.456
Do you want spaghetti?

00:24:40.156 --> 00:24:40.855
What are you reading?

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:43.355
Can you share it with me?

00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:44.656
With this serious stare,

00:24:44.656 --> 00:24:46.856
how can I continue reading, huh?

00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:48.456
Let me read it, please.

00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:50.356
No!

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:52.956
I like it when you’re with me.

00:24:52.956 --> 00:24:54.055
The pool villa vibes

00:24:54.055 --> 00:24:56.255
are so good.

00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:26.255
Hey! Do you know how to do it?

00:25:26.755 --> 00:25:28.456
Stay still!

00:25:28.456 --> 00:25:29.255
Can I have a look?

00:25:29.255 --> 00:25:30.456
Hey, Pure!

00:25:34.656 --> 00:25:35.755
You’re a bad student.

00:25:35.755 --> 00:25:37.156
No point given.

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:39.755
Oh! It hasn’t finished.

00:25:39.755 --> 00:25:41.456
It looks good, anyway.

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:42.156
Terrible!

00:25:42.156 --> 00:25:43.255
I’ve had all.

00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:44.055
Hey, what?!

00:25:44.055 --> 00:25:44.856
What?! Come on!

00:25:44.856 --> 00:25:45.755
Pure!

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:46.456
Hey!

00:25:46.456 --> 00:25:47.456
Hey!

00:25:47.456 --> 00:25:49.255
Ooh!

00:25:49.255 --> 00:25:50.856
What?!

00:25:50.856 --> 00:25:51.956
There you go!

00:25:51.956 --> 00:25:54.155
What are you doing? Huh?!

00:25:54.155 --> 00:25:56.956
Here you are!

00:25:56.956 --> 00:25:59.456
Can you wait for me to finish?

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:53.856
You asked me to join in swimming, but you don’t swim?!

00:26:53.856 --> 00:26:55.856
Worse than that, you don’t share things to eat.

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:58.456
I just wanted you to swim. It’s my plan.

00:26:58.456 --> 00:26:59.155
I more enjoy

00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:02.256
watching your swimming.

00:27:02.256 --> 00:27:02.856
Ah.

00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:07.055
Do you want this?

00:27:07.055 --> 00:27:09.055
Ah.

00:27:09.055 --> 00:27:10.356
Ah.

00:27:17.055 --> 00:27:18.256
Come on!

00:28:55.855 --> 00:28:56.655
Oh, Loft!

00:28:56.655 --> 00:28:59.456
You came back already?

00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:00.855
Did you eat anything?

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:02.456
Do you want me to cook?

00:29:15.756 --> 00:29:18.456
What about pork boiled rice?

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:21.056
You told me you’ll be coming back next week.

00:29:21.056 --> 00:29:23.655
So I didn’t ask anyone to prepare any food for you.

00:29:23.655 --> 00:29:24.855
That’s okay.

00:29:24.855 --> 00:29:27.256
It’s enough for me.

00:29:27.256 --> 00:29:28.155
Err…well.

00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:34.056
Why is it earlier than expected?

00:29:34.056 --> 00:29:34.956
Oops! I’m sorry.

00:29:34.956 --> 00:29:38.956
I didn’t mean to ask about your personal matter.

00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:41.456
I’m worried about the work.

00:29:41.456 --> 00:29:43.056
Umm.

00:29:43.056 --> 00:29:43.655
So.
75
Shall I reschedule the meetings?

00:29:45.155 --> 00:29:46.855
They can be faster.

00:29:46.855 --> 00:29:47.756
Umm.

00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:48.756
Good.

00:29:48.756 --> 00:29:50.056
It’s good to have you here.

00:29:50.056 --> 00:29:53.756
I feel more comfortable.

00:29:54.756 --> 00:29:56.456
Well,

00:29:56.456 --> 00:29:59.956
the maid told me you normally come back with a close friend.

00:29:59.956 --> 00:30:01.756
Is she coming with you?

00:30:01.756 --> 00:30:04.756
If yes, I’m preparing her room now.

00:30:04.756 --> 00:30:07.456
She might not be here anymore.

00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:11.756
Err.

00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:13.056
Ploy,

00:30:13.056 --> 00:30:14.456
you don’t need to do the dish.

00:30:14.456 --> 00:30:17.456
Leave it to the maid tomorrow.

00:30:17.456 --> 00:30:18.855
Okay.

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:20.155
If you’ve anything for me to help,

00:30:20.155 --> 00:30:22.456
you can let me know whenever.

00:30:26.855 --> 00:30:27.655
Good night.

00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:30.456
Good night.

00:30:30.456 --> 00:30:33.756
Ploy!

00:30:33.756 --> 00:30:38.756
Yes.

00:30:38.756 --> 00:30:40.056
Err.

00:30:40.056 --> 00:30:44.056
Can you drink wine with me?

00:30:44.056 --> 00:30:47.456
Sure.

00:30:55.756 --> 00:30:56.456
You know, he …

00:30:56.456 --> 00:30:59.456
hit me before

00:30:59.456 --> 00:31:03.355
right here at the ear.

00:31:03.355 --> 00:31:05.155
Well,

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:06.956
I almost passed out.

00:31:06.956 --> 00:31:09.456
I fell on the ground.

00:31:09.456 --> 00:31:11.456
Later, I woke up with confusion.

00:31:11.456 --> 00:31:14.756
How could he do that to me?

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:17.756
But there was something worse.

00:31:17.756 --> 00:31:18.956
Well, …

00:31:18.956 --> 00:31:21.956
I forgave him.

00:31:21.956 --> 00:31:23.456
He hit me.

00:31:23.456 --> 00:31:25.655
He cheated on me.

00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:27.655
I thought he terribly did something bad to be

00:31:27.655 --> 00:31:31.456
because of his short temper.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.456
I think no one could stand him as much as I used to.

00:31:34.456 --> 00:31:37.855
I didn’t know why I took his side that much.

00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:39.655
Maybe, it was because …

00:31:39.655 --> 00:31:41.256
because of love.

00:31:41.256 --> 00:31:42.956
Umm.

00:31:42.956 --> 00:31:43.956
Yes.

00:31:43.956 --> 00:31:46.355
Yes, it was love.

00:31:46.355 --> 00:31:48.855
Because I loved him.

00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:49.756
That’s it.

00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:53.456
I used to think love might change a bad one to be better.

00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:55.456
How did you leave him?

00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:57.355
Umm.

00:31:57.355 --> 00:31:59.956
I just broke it off suddenly.

00:31:59.956 --> 00:32:01.956
I took all stuff

00:32:01.956 --> 00:32:06.756
and moved to live with my mom.

00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:09.756
After moving on,

00:32:09.756 --> 00:32:11.855
it was like I was born again

00:32:11.855 --> 00:32:13.656
with a better life.

00:32:13.656 --> 00:32:15.956
Okay.

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:16.656
But,

00:32:16.656 --> 00:32:17.956
it isn’t easy.

00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:20.056
It’s not easy for a replacement.

00:32:20.056 --> 00:32:22.656
Ooh!

00:32:22.656 --> 00:32:24.456
You know?

00:32:24.456 --> 00:32:26.456
In the sea

00:32:26.456 --> 00:32:28.755
there’re plenty of fish.

00:32:28.755 --> 00:32:30.956
Have you tried fishing?

00:32:30.956 --> 00:32:33.656
You’d better try it.

00:32:33.656 --> 00:32:34.456
What about you?

00:32:34.456 --> 00:32:37.755
Have you?

00:32:43.755 --> 00:32:44.855
Huh. It’s midnight.

00:32:44.855 --> 00:32:46.755
You can leave for a rest.

00:32:46.755 --> 00:32:47.855
Thank you so much

00:32:47.855 --> 00:32:49.755
for being here with me.

00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:50.456
And …

00:32:50.456 --> 00:32:51.755
I’m sorry

00:32:51.755 --> 00:32:54.056
for talking to you until it’s late.

00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:55.855
No problem at all.

00:32:55.855 --> 00:32:56.956
It’s okay.

00:32:56.956 --> 00:32:58.855
Are you alright?

00:32:58.855 --> 00:33:00.456
Sure.

00:33:00.456 --> 00:33:02.456
Slowly, please.

00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:04.255
Well, Ploy!

00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:05.855
You can be in late tomorrow.

00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:06.456
But

00:33:06.456 --> 00:33:08.456
please tell the office that

00:33:08.456 --> 00:33:10.456
I’m getting in late in the afternoon.

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:12.755
Umm.

00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:16.056
Copied that.

00:33:16.056 --> 00:33:17.456
Good night.

00:33:17.456 --> 00:33:21.355
Good night.

00:33:21.355 --> 00:33:23.456
Walk slowly.

00:33:46.056 --> 00:33:50.456
Tonight, Khun Lamp’s sleeping over at the main house.

00:33:50.456 --> 00:33:52.656
I’ve told Ms. Juthamas already that

00:33:52.656 --> 00:33:54.056
you’re coming home late.

00:33:54.056 --> 00:33:55.456
But she’s …

00:33:55.456 --> 00:33:56.355
No problem.

00:33:56.355 --> 00:33:57.656
I’ll take care of her.

00:33:57.656 --> 00:33:59.456
You can take a rest, Phen.

00:34:05.255 --> 00:34:05.755
Air,

00:34:05.755 --> 00:34:08.056
you must apologize Lamp’s parents.

00:34:08.056 --> 00:34:09.355
You must tell them you’ve changed your mind.

00:34:09.355 --> 00:34:12.156
Tell them you don’t want to divorce.

00:34:12.156 --> 00:34:14.855
Why do I have to do that?

00:34:14.855 --> 00:34:15.755
That’s my order.

00:34:15.755 --> 00:34:18.755
Can you stop directing me?

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:20.855
Don’t you know

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:21.755
what I want?

00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:23.456
Yes, I know.

00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:27.156
You want to go back to that woman.

00:34:27.156 --> 00:34:28.855
How good is she?

00:34:28.855 --> 00:34:30.255
Why have you longed for the return?

00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:32.456
Yes.

00:34:32.456 --> 00:34:34.956
I want to go back to her.

00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:37.456
But congratulations, Mom!

00:34:37.456 --> 00:34:39.056
I can’t make it.

00:34:39.056 --> 00:34:40.456
It’s too late.

00:34:40.456 --> 00:34:42.855
What are you waiting for then?

00:34:42.855 --> 00:34:44.255
You must return to Lamp.

00:34:44.255 --> 00:34:44.656
Let’s go!

00:34:44.656 --> 00:34:46.056
Now!

00:34:46.056 --> 00:34:47.556
That’s enough, Mom.

00:34:47.556 --> 00:34:49.956
I’m a human.

00:34:49.956 --> 00:34:51.855
I’m not a robot doll.

00:34:51.855 --> 00:34:56.656
You can’t control me.

00:34:56.656 --> 00:34:58.855
Do you ever know? Mom,

00:34:58.855 --> 00:35:01.656
if I could choose something,

00:35:01.656 --> 00:35:03.056
I wouldn’t want to be your child.

00:35:03.056 --> 00:35:04.156
What did you say?

00:35:04.156 --> 00:35:05.456
I don’t want to be your daughter.

00:35:11.755 --> 00:35:16.456
Why did it turn out like this?

00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:21.355
Since you were young, you’ve never argued with me.

00:35:21.355 --> 00:35:23.656
Because of that woman,

00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:24.956
right?

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:28.656
It isn’t about Pure.

00:35:32.355 --> 00:35:35.255
It’s me, Mom.

00:35:35.255 --> 00:35:38.755
I’ve chosen it myself.

00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:41.956
If I had nothing left,

00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:46.056
I wouldn’t care about anything.

00:35:46.056 --> 00:35:48.855
You can get mad at me, hate me or whatever.

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:50.956
Just do it!

00:35:50.956 --> 00:35:52.456
It’s enough for me.

00:36:07.255 --> 00:36:09.855
Air!

00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:11.755
Air!

00:36:14.755 --> 00:36:17.456
Air!!!

00:36:19.456 --> 00:36:21.855
Where’s the painting that’s being used in the exhibition opening?

00:36:21.855 --> 00:36:25.755
Where is it now?

00:36:25.755 --> 00:36:29.355
Are you alright?

00:36:56.897 --> 00:37:00.296
I haven’t seen you for ages. Where have you been up to?

00:37:00.296 --> 00:37:02.996
Have you been busy?

00:37:02.996 --> 00:37:03.996
Yes.

00:37:03.996 --> 00:37:05.697
The event is coming soon.

00:37:05.697 --> 00:37:09.097
There’re many things to do.

00:37:09.097 --> 00:37:12.097
Have you overthought as well?

00:37:17.097 --> 00:37:19.597
Uh.

00:37:22.597 --> 00:37:25.996
Why ‘Eyes Never Lie’, huh?

00:37:25.996 --> 00:37:28.896
Eyes won’t lie, Mom.

00:37:28.896 --> 00:37:30.297
Looking into the eyes

00:37:30.297 --> 00:37:32.097
let us perceive

00:37:32.097 --> 00:37:33.297
emotions,

00:37:33.297 --> 00:37:34.597
feelings,

00:37:34.597 --> 00:37:36.597
And the true self of the other one

00:37:36.597 --> 00:37:46.097
without a word.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:48.597
If we want to know if someone likes us or not,

00:37:48.597 --> 00:37:50.597
just look into the eyes of that person.

00:37:50.597 --> 00:37:53.597
Then you’ll know their feelings and thoughts.

00:37:53.597 --> 00:37:56.597
On the other hand,

00:37:56.597 --> 00:37:59.097
if we do something wrong,

00:37:59.097 --> 00:38:00.597
we don’t want anyone

00:38:00.597 --> 00:38:03.597
to look into our eyes.

00:38:03.597 --> 00:38:05.597
Because we’re afraid that the other side will know

00:38:05.597 --> 00:38:08.597
we do something bad.

00:38:08.597 --> 00:38:10.597
Or

00:38:10.597 --> 00:38:13.097
we might be afraid that

00:38:13.097 --> 00:38:16.097
the other person might know we aren’t as good

00:38:16.097 --> 00:38:18.597
as it seems to be.

00:38:24.597 --> 00:38:29.597
Where’s the painting that’s being used in the exhibition opening?

00:38:33.597 --> 00:38:35.597
Are you okay?

00:38:44.597 --> 00:38:47.597
Mom,

00:38:47.597 --> 00:38:52.597
Am I bad?

00:38:52.597 --> 00:38:55.597
What happened?

00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:01.597
Well,

00:39:01.597 --> 00:39:04.597
Air’s come back to me.

00:39:04.597 --> 00:39:08.597
She’s divorcing soon.

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:12.597
But I don’t love her anymore.

00:39:12.597 --> 00:39:13.397
Because …

00:39:13.397 --> 00:39:22.597
Because of Loft?

00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:25.597
I don’t know what I should do.

00:39:25.597 --> 00:39:29.597
No matter which one I choose,

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:34.597
there’ll always be one who will be disappointed.

00:39:34.597 --> 00:39:37.597
Without thinking about being guilty,

00:39:37.597 --> 00:39:41.597
who’s your most happiness?

00:39:41.597 --> 00:39:43.597
It’s Loft.

00:39:43.597 --> 00:39:45.597
But...

00:39:45.597 --> 00:39:48.597
Listen to me.

00:39:48.597 --> 00:39:50.597
If you’re thinking about the past

00:39:50.597 --> 00:39:52.597
or worrying about the future,

00:39:52.597 --> 00:39:57.597
it doesn’t help at all.

00:39:57.597 --> 00:40:00.597
Listen to your own heart.

00:40:03.597 --> 00:40:05.597
I believe time can heal everything

00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:12.597
in any sad and painful circumstances.

00:40:12.597 --> 00:40:13.597
Mom!

00:40:39.597 --> 00:40:44.597
She’s in

00:40:44.597 --> 00:40:48.597
the painting there, right?

00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:38.597
Loving someone who isn’t right

00:41:38.597 --> 00:41:40.597
is like drug and liquor addiction.

00:41:40.597 --> 00:41:43.097
You know?

00:41:43.097 --> 00:41:46.597
It’s just exciting for a short time,

00:41:46.597 --> 00:41:49.597
and after that you want to throw up.

00:41:49.597 --> 00:41:52.597
Your stomach is upset.

00:41:52.597 --> 00:41:53.597
Hungover.

00:41:53.597 --> 00:41:57.597
And you repeat the same loop.

00:41:57.597 --> 00:41:59.597
It sounds like riding a roller coaster.

00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:01.597
Yes, a roller coaster.

00:42:01.597 --> 00:42:02.597
Therefore,

00:42:02.597 --> 00:42:03.597
the only one way

00:42:03.597 --> 00:42:07.597
that helps is …

00:42:07.597 --> 00:42:09.597
‘Out of sight’!

00:42:09.597 --> 00:42:11.597
‘Out of mind’!

00:43:06.597 --> 00:43:08.597
Loft,

00:43:08.597 --> 00:43:11.597
can you pick answer the phone?

00:43:11.597 --> 00:43:13.597
Don’t be this quiet.

00:43:13.597 --> 00:43:15.597
I really want to talk to you.

00:44:33.097 --> 00:44:34.597
Can I talk to Loft, please?

00:44:34.597 --> 00:44:36.597
If Pure calls me, please tell her I’m not in,

00:44:36.597 --> 00:44:38.597
You can’t let go of her, right?

00:44:38.597 --> 00:44:39.597
Uh.

00:44:39.597 --> 00:44:41.597
If it’s like this, …

00:44:41.597 --> 00:44:44.597
It’s alright.

00:44:44.897 --> 00:44:45.597
What happened, Air?

00:44:45.597 --> 00:44:47.597
Heartbroken.

00:44:47.597 --> 00:44:49.597
Pure’s already had someone else.

00:44:49.597 --> 00:44:50.597
And

00:44:50.597 --> 00:44:53.597
do you know that person?

00:44:53.597 --> 00:44:55.597
She hasn’t contacted you for a week like this,

00:44:55.597 --> 00:44:56.597
What’s next?

00:44:56.597 --> 00:44:57.597
I just know that

00:44:57.597 --> 00:45:00.597
I’m not going to wait for anything.
