[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.910
[Episode 33]

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.920
Qiushui.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.920
Back then,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.280
everyone in the Xiao family

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.210
was waiting for you and Yiren
to return and save them.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.950
No one ever thought

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.520
I could save the Xiao family.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.870
But I knew

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.920
I could help the Xiao family
overcome the crisis!

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.630
As long as I obtained
the Voidheart Codex,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.160
I could change everything!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960
Why?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.520
Why

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.690
couldn't I be the hero of the Xiao family?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.310
You murderous monster!

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
You killed Father and Mother

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.300
and destroyed our Xiao family!

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.150
You madman!

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.520
How dare you call yourself a hero!

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.030
Oh, don't get upset just yet.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.430
There are even more exciting things

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.690
waiting for you ahead.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.700
Zhu the Great King's vision
is still too limited.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760
My ambition is far greater than his.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.940
The strong only seize and plunder;

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.270
it is only the weak
who talk about benevolence and morality!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.000
Winning

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.430
is the only standard.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.750
Qiushui,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.680
once I rule the world,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.170
you'll all prostrate yourselves
at my feet,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.030
bowing down and swearing fealty!

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.750
Xiao Kaiyan.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.750
I won't let you have your way.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.360
Money,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.600
the new book,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.120
the byline—

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.040
these are all negotiable.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.820
My matters can wait,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.650
but selling state secrets
to foreign powers

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.370
is an entirely different matter.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.510
Let go!

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.360
Give it to me!

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.830
Let go now!

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.510
We finally meet.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.640
You...

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.660
Who are you?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.950
I am you,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.720
and you are me.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.680
So this isn't a dream?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.000
Have you forgotten
how glorious we had it over there?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.460
We got whatever we wanted,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.180
whenever we wanted it.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.910
Nothing like the frustration we face here.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.510
Having known the ending of the book,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.430
do you still want to follow the same fate?

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.110
You duel with Xiao Yiren,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.510
and in the end you're defeated by
his Two-Hearts-as-One Sword Technique.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.570
With your dying breath, you cry out
that the Huanhua Sect has no traitors—

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.550
and never will.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.650
What gives you the right
to say this is my fate?

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.320
Enough.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.600
I don't want to hear any of this.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600
Stop pretending.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.870
From the moment you time-traveled into
this body of mine,

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.120
you knew how it would end—

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.510
you were destined to be nothing
more than cannon fodder.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.510
While alive,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.890
you can only serve as Qiushui's foil;

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.770
and when you die,
you're completely worthless.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.870
No one will remember you!

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.670
They only remember the victors!

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.000
No, that's not true.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.160
Stop talking nonsense.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.470
I'm not the way you think I am.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.040
Quit the act.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.400
Do you think I don't know

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.820
what you're really thinking?

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.830
Over there, we practically had the world
in the palm of our hand.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.190
We can do the same here.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.870
Just have at it, become
the master of the Xiao family,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.800
become someone people admire,
worship, and follow,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.650
and become the ruler of this world!

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.830
Go to Xiao's Sword Manor.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.250
The Voidheart Codex
is waiting for you there.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.680
I...

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.950
Is this the only way

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.310
to change my fate?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.680
The Voidheart Codex?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.030
The ultimate martial arts manual.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.580
You did it, Xiao Kaiyan!

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.870
Let's go change our fate!

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.200
C-Constable Tieyi?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.720
Luckily, Qiushui warned us
before he left

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.140
to keep an eye on the people around us.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.760
Your father and I just
tested him a little,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.250
and he immediately showed his true colors.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.170
He stayed at our Sword Manor
pretending to help,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.650
but it turns out it was all for
the Hero Command Token.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.600
The Hero Command Token?

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.740
So he's also after the Voidheart Codex.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.670
Haven't you been looking for
the Voidheart Codex all this time?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.870
Today, I'll let you see it for yourself!

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.450
Kaiyan!

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.290
Kaiyan! What are you doing?

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.670
Kaiyan! Let go!

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.000
Mother!

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.630
Mother!

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:18.730
Mother!

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.890
Mother, what's wrong?

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.750
I didn't mean to.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:23.990
Mother...

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.680
I know...

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.110
That you...

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.590
That you didn't mean to do that.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.480
Kaiyan.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.560
Shan?

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.270
Shan!

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.030
Kaiyan!

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.770
What happened here?

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.500
Father. Father.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.600
Father, it's not what it seems.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.770
Mother was...

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.310
Mother was killed by him.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.910
Why does you Huanhua
pretend to be some righteous sect?

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.440
Xiao Kaiyan learned the Voidheart Codex,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.040
and that's why he accidentally
killed his own mother.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.190
Father. Father.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.910
I-I didn't mean to.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.270
It was my fault.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.770
I... I...

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.930
You unfilial child!

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.510
Tell me,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.190
when did you secretly learn
those martial skills?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.410
And

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.750
where are Yiren and Qiushui?

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.790
Could it be

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.240
you killed them too?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.130
How has our Xiao family wronged you?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.790
Why did you do that?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.800
I just wanted to prove myself,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.040
to prove that I, Xiao Kaiyan,
could save our Xiao family.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.120
Did you and Mother ever

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.550
pay any attention to me, your second son?

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.290
To learn and practice constantly,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.550
is that not a pleasure?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.290
To have friends come from afar,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.490
is that not a delight?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.960
To stay unbothered when misunderstood,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.240
isn't that noble?

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.090
Applause.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.620
-Impressive!
-Truly impressive.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.030
Excellent.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.050
-Right?
-It's getting late.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.870
Let's eat first.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.990
Alright, dinner time.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.190
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.880
Come on, Qiushui, hurry.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.370
-Pick it up.
-Give me your hand.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.570
Qiushui, be careful.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.370
Read to them again this afternoon,
will you?

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:58.600
Kaiyan.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.910
What are you doing again?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.080
Waiting for me to feed you?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.000
Hurry up and go.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.110
Always so unhurried about everything.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.660
Xilou,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.270
do you think Qiushui
has a talent for martial arts?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.890
He's my son after all.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.760
He'll be just like Yiren someday.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.390
Yiren is naturally gifted,
a martial arts prodigy.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.510
But what about...

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.400
What about Qiushui?

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.360
He's so stubborn and unruly,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.510
yet time and again he manages

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.440
to earn your protection and favor.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.430
What am I then?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.960
I just wanted to prove to you

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.800
that I can do it,
and you were wrong about me!

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.440
Kaiyan.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.000
Why would you think that way?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.850
Why would I think that way?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.750
Why would I think that way...

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.790
Why would I think that way!

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.000
It's all your fault,

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.670
you murderous demon!

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.150
If it weren't for you,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.720
I would never have accidentally
killed my mother,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.000
and she wouldn't have died!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.330
It's all because of you!

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.980
Have you forgotten?

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.150
I am you, Xiao Kaiyan.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.100
That's not true!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.150
Stop talking.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.870
You murderous demon!

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.610
Enough!

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.500
You did it but don't dare own up to it?

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.070
You are... You are me.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.150
And I am...

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:55.630
I am you.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.440
Xiao Kaiyan.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.360
We just want to change our fate.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.170
What's wrong with that?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.000
Since you've done it,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.930
there's no need to doubt yourself.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.360
Just face it.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.190
Shut up!

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.240
Xiao Kaiyan!

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.390
You've done nothing wrong.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.390
Those who achieve greatness
shouldn't care about such things!

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.520
We can definitely become
the ruler of the martial world!

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.460
The ruler of the martial world...

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:33.910
I've done nothing wrong.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.890
It's all fate's fault.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.170
Since fate is at fault,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.170
I will correct every mistake,

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.320
one by one.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.800
Those who achieve greatness

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.360
are supposed be ruthless like you.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.030
With my waterways' influence
in the martial world

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.030
and the Thousand-Faces Mask
in my possession,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.430
I believe that together,

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.510
we can accomplish much more.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.240
Right.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.670
You've obtained the Voidheart Codex,

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.600
but your skills aren't mature enough.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.130
To achieve dominance
over the martial world,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.550
you need me.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.080
Moreover, with your parents' deaths,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.120
will the Xiao family let you off?

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.510
When help arrives,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.320
do you think you'll have
any chance of survival?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.120
Only I

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.380
can help you resolve these concerns.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.000
Don't forget,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.480
they all saw you return first.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.810
From today onwards,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.069
Zhu the Great King's waterways
and the Northern Wasteland's

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.070
Falconry Whistle
will both be at my disposal.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.080
The Sect Leaders of Shaolin and Wudang

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.800
have rushed to the Xiao Residence.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.840
Go stop them,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.680
and end their lives.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.240
My fate is only up to me.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.920
Whether it's Xiao Mingming

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.350
or Xiao Qiushui,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.180
I will defeat you.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.440
I, Xiao Kaiyan,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.360
will definitely dominate
and rule the martial world.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:35.960
Xiao Kaiyan

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.320
turns out to be the real culprit
behind the Xilou couple's deaths.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.920
Who would have thought he obtained
the Thousand-Faces Mask

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.130
and transformed himself into
Zhu the Great King?

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.160
The previous Zhu the Great King,
with his dual identity,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.000
infiltrated the martial world
for over 20 years, which allowed

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.130
the Falconry Whistle Organization
to take root in Daxi.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.910
And now here comes an impostor,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.160
who's every bit as strong, if not more.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.590
Chief,

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.350
you shouldn't overexert yourself.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.350
Why is Chief's cold so severe?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.280
There have been many sect matters
requiring Chief's attention.

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.000
Besides, he took trips

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.920
to Mount Emei's Golden Summit
and Nantian Abyss successively,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.440
and upon returning, he hurried
straight to the imperial audience,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.640
thus led to illness from overexertion.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.350
However,

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.510
Chief's condition isn't serious.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.570
With plenty of rest

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.110
and less strain,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.510
his health will recover.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.370
Xiao Kaiyan is really ambitious.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.460
By impersonating Zhu the Great King,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.070
he has already gained His Majesty's trust.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.200
First, he infiltrated the martial world
with Falconry Whistle,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.060
then he made His Majesty his ally.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.350
Now even with the strength of
our Power Gang,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.510
it would be difficult
to challenge his influence.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:54.400
If we can join forces with the major sects

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.930
such as Shaolin and Wudang,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.440
we will surely rally widespread support,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.960
attract more forces,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.000
and collectively oppose
Zhu the Great King.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.920
Unfortunately, in
that battle at the Sword Manor,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.180
Deputy Chief Liu ended up offending
all those major sects.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.480
Chief, please make sure
to put your health first.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.180
The current predicament of the Power Gang
was caused by me,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.130
and I should be the one to end it.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.970
I cannot let Chief be troubled.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.300
[Maintain Balance]

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.700
Here, Zhu the Great King.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.070
I'd like to offer you a toast.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.530
Cheers.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.680
The Xiao family
has received imperial favor

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.140
and wiped away past shame.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.880
Word has spread like wildfire
throughout the martial world.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.330
Congratulations.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.190
Were it not for you, Zhu the Great King,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.850
our Xiao family wouldn't
have this glory today.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.480
However,

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.350
whether you can maintain this glory

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.030
is up to you.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.920
Now the opportunity has come.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.160
His Majesty wants you to do something
for him.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.720
If you get it done successfully,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.650
your Xiao family
will be protected for generations.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.070
I wonder what His Majesty's order is?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.180
Disguise as the Wu Army at the front line,

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.570
find some Northern Wasteland soldiers,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.510
and then...

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.180
What are you afraid of?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.880
With your skills, Xiao Yiren,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.160
infiltrating the Northern Wasteland
enemy camp

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.960
should be a piece of cake, right?

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.720
Why would His Majesty give such an order?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.720
It's just to give the imperial court

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.680
a reason to recall General Wu.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.750
If this fails,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.040
it will unsettle everyone.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.550
But General Wu

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.830
is a loyal general
who serves the state with all his heart.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.510
And I, as an honorable warrior,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.240
should also risk my life
for the people of Daxi.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.510
This sword in my hand—

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.070
how could it be used for such deeds?

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.470
Call yourself a warrior?

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.400
Whether this plaque says
"Loyal Hero of Jinzhong"

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.550
or "Traitor of Jinzhong"

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.920
is utterly up to me, isn't it?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.240
What do you mean?

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.600
Are you threatening me?

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.200
Yes.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.590
Not only can I threaten you,

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.370
I can also stomp you to death,
Xiao Yiren.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.000
At this point,

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.310
do you think you still have a way out?

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.550
Let me tell you,

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.770
if you can't get this done,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.480
you'll go back to
being the traitor of Jinzhong,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.080
and the Xiao family
will be disgraced forever.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.210
However,

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.710
you could also cut ties with
the Xiao family

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.930
and give your position to
that brother of yours.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.030
This way, you'll have nothing to do with
the Xiao family anymore.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.160
How does that sound?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.000
What?

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.900
Not willing?

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.270
Look at you,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.170
how ridiculous.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.330
You're not even willing to
give up a title,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.830
and you call yourself a warrior?

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.240
Actually, you guys are just like me,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.380
clinging to fame and fortune.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.680
You're just more hypocritical than I am,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.400
hiding behind the banner of justice

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.240
while chasing fame and profit.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.240
There's nothing shameful about that.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.650
Admit it, Xiao Yiren.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.330
That's more like it.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.290
In fact, you and I are
the same kind of person.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.760
It'll make things much easier
between us from now on.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:48.680
What?

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.880
Qiushui's second brother
killed their parents

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.740
and wiped out Yuhan's family too?

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.510
What's with his two brothers?

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.110
Each one's worse than the last!

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.000
Say a little less, will you?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.920
But it's true!

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.150
What happened in the past

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.850
cannot be changed now.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.310
What I'm more concerned about now is

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.310
what his next move will be.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.480
Unfortunately,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.030
your second brother
stole the Voidheart Codex.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.680
Now it's extremely difficult

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.640
to defeat him.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.050
Now that Zhu the Great King's forces
are at his disposal,

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.880
trying to stop him

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.680
won't be that easy.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.480
Qiushui!

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.000
Bad news!

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.240
Bad news!

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.400
His Majesty has sent an imperial decree
to the Immortal Pass,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.000
summoning General Wu Jie to return to
the capital immediately.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.070
All the major sects in the martial world

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.310
are urgently discussing countermeasures.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.450
Although the Northern Wasteland
seems to be talking peace with Daxi,

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.910
they keep provoking us
at the Immortal Pass.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.220
If General Wu were to leave
the Immortal Pass at a time like this,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.840
it would surely cause
great unrest among the people

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.480
and likely affect
the morale of the guarding soldiers.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.170
Indeed,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.920
but imperial orders cannot be defied.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.070
However, if General Wu doesn't return now,

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.180
he'll certainly be charged with

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.510
some fabricated crime.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.240
In that case,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.310
whether he comes back or not,

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.370
it's problematic.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.550
What concerns us now

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.480
is that the soldiers at the front
and the court officials

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.790
might waver in their resolve
to resist the enemy.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.310
Wouldn't that give the Northern Wasteland

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.070
a perfect opportunity to strike
while we're vulnerable?

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.830
General Wu absolutely cannot return.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:09.400
By the way,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.480
as for the Power Gang,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.400
Liu Suifeng has gone to
Wudang and Shaolin to apologize.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.560
I hope this isn't another scheme.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.120
Killing Seniors Tianzheng and Taichan

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.030
wasn't the intention of the Power Gang.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.920
It was I, Liu Suifeng,
who misplaced my trust

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.450
and fell into a trap of deception.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.240
However, my crimes of murder are real,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.130
and I dare not make excuses.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.590
Today, I, Liu Suifeng, am willing to

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.790
accept any punishment
without a word of complaint.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.320
All I ask is that after this,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.440
you no longer hold
the Power Gang responsible.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.850
[Heroes of Our Era]

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.510
Liu Suifeng,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.240
Your crimes are grave,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.970
and death would be too lenient.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.870
But now the martial world is in decline,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.890
and Daxi faces troubles
both within and without.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.950
If the Power Gang truly has the will
to resist the enemy,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.400
the martial world would welcome it.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.830
Today, your life is spared for now.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.370
Go kill enemies to redeem yourself.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.270
I happened to meet
Masters Muye and Fanhua from Shaolin

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.990
and Masters Yinping and Tieji from Wudang

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.160
competing martial techniques against

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.960
Seniors East Sword, West Sword,

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.970
Zhang Canjin, and Wan Suiyu.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.960
All eight elders passed their skills to me
before they died.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.200
Amitabha.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.620
Everything happens for a reason.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.790
It's also said in this letter that

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.710
someone stole the Thousand-Faces Mask
from the Fei family,

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.040
committed murders at Xiao's Sword Manor,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.000
incited conflicts between sects,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
and even attempted to sow division among
the martial world of Daxi.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.550
This person disguised himself

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.680
as Zhu the Great King
of the Long River waterways.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.960
Who's the impostor?

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.990
Huanhua knows that without evidence,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.960
mere words won't persuade anyone.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.920
Once we find the evidence,

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.110
we'll surely present it.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.400
It's just this impostor is cunning
and full of tricks,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.920
and he carries
the Thousand-Faces Mask around.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.200
We hope all martial sects
can stay on guard

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.920
to avoid falling into his trap.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.270
Amitabha.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.550
This matter is of great importance.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.480
We hope you'll investigate it thoroughly,
Mr. Xiao.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.660
Suifeng has gone to Shaolin
and Wudang to apologize.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.040
The leaders of both sects
refused to see him

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.000
and told him to repent on his own.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.450
If that's the case,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.850
then I'll absorb more people's
internal energy.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.930
What can the so-called "backlash"

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.440
possibly do to me?

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.440
Xiao Qiushui.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.120
[Xiao Residence]

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.310
Yiren.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.880
Is this how you envisioned

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.700
restoring the Xiao family back then?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.630
Yes.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.640
You can go ahead and mock me.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.070
Now, with the Changge Sword in your hand

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.200
and all your skills,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.090
you're truly impressive, aren't you?

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.790
Yiren, you're wrong.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.560
Even if I had no martial skills,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.230
I would never challenge the impossible

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.070
or side with evil.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.260
Then what should I do?

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.510
Tell me, what must I do

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.710
to turn all of this back to
the way it was?

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.640
If it weren't for you,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.400
how would the Xiao family
have become like this,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.460
at the disposal of Zhu the Great King?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.680
Qiushui,

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.070
I'm not a deity.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.790
I couldn't have predicted that my once
carefree and mischievous brother Qiushui

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.880
would suddenly excel at everything.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.630
I also couldn't have predictd
how you suddenly became so prescient,

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.240
knowing the Sword King's identity
right away.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.940
I also couldn't have known

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.200
that you would take the Infinite Pill,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.450
obtain the Hero Command Token,

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.540
and master all those martial skills!

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.160
But do you know

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.200
that everything I've done

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.960
is also for our Xiao family?

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.020
Do you understand

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.480
how much pain and exhaustion

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.310
I've endured

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.400
for this family?

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.090
I don't know why

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.640
things have become like this either.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.640
I'm sorry, Yiren.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.070
I didn't mean to blame you.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.720
But Yiren,

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.900
no matter what, you must not trust

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.120
Zhu the Great King.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.370
Father and Mother,

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.080
the entire Xiao family—

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.920
all of this

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.440
was his doing.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.440
That can't be.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.199
On the day Sword Manor fell,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.580
he was at the Long River waterways.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.590
How could he have entered the Sword Manor?

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.280
Besides,

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.460
how could he have broken through

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.860
the Sword Manor's impenetrable defenses?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.750
Zhu the Great King couldn't,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.550
but he's not just Zhu the Great King.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.679
That's right.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.320
It's Kaiyan.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.480
Xiao Kaiyan.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.760
Qiushui, what nonsense
are you talking about?

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.880
Kaiyan has always been kind and gentle,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.480
never one to fight for power.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.489
How can you slander him like this?

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:01.120
Yiren,

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.670
I'm not slandering him.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.710
He admitted it himself.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.710
He has the Fei family's treasure,
the Thousand-Faces Mask,

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.240
allowing him to take on
anyone's appearance,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.810
including Zhu the Great King.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.070
No,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.090
that's impossible.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.430
Zhu the Great King
has long been famous.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.960
How could Kaiyan impersonate him,

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.400
and why would he do such a thing?

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.200
Kaiyan is different now.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.250
I don't understand
why he acted that way either.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.070
But Yiren,

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.630
he's done many things behind our backs.

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.110
He even killed our parents

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.160
and slaughtered the entire Xiao family

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.380
to master the Voidheart Codex.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.440
Yiren!

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.300
Retreat now!

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.900
-Young Master, let's go!
-I'll cover the rear!

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.550
Kaiyan.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.630
You still haven't told me

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.480
how you fell off that cliff

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.850
and how you survived at the bottom.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.490
Xueyu and I thought you...

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.840
Perhaps I fought for too long,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.280
but now I'm dazed
and can't remember anything.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.960
Maybe I was just blessed with
great fortune.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.670
I don't understand why Kaiyan

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.470
would become like this, either.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.150
Now, he just

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.050
wants to plunge the world into turmoil

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.550
and see Daxi annihilated.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.920
That's complete nonsense!

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.550
Enough.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.880
Stop this ridiculous talk.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.450
Get out of here.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.840
Go!

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.360
Yiren.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.200
I've buried Mother and Father's bodies

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.960
back at the Sword Manor.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.400
When you have time,

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:26.230
you should go visit them.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:48.290
[Zhu Residence]

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.930
It seems you already know everything,
Yiren.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.520
So it's really you.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.410
Was it you who killed our parents?

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.190
Why?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.400
Yiren, did you fall for
Xiao Qiushui's lies

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.670
just like that?

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.630
I was also raised by them.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.110
How could I possibly dare to do anything

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.760
disrespectful to them?

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.320
Even now,

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.720
you're still denying it?

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.580
I saw your Thousand-Faces Mask just now!

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.320
I never imagined

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:21.270
that my little brother I watched grow up

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.100
would now disguise himself as
Zhu the Great King!

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.410
How can I trust you now?

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.520
Since the Xiao family was massacred,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.160
you've been devastated, right?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.860
You've been thinking obsessively every day

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.070
that as long as you could avenge

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.920
and restore the Xiao family,

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.050
you're willing to do anything, right?

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.840
So am I.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.240
I've thought about it countless times

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.550
and finally come to understand that

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.800
I can no longer rely on you

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.670
like I used to.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.400
I had to become ruthless

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.820
to have any chance.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.910
The Power Gang is strong,

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.370
so I must become even stronger than them.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.140
The Power Gang is evil,

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.750
so I have to be
even more ruthless than they are.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.090
That's the only way in this martial world.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.150
Zhu the Great King is actually Zhu Xiawu.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.320
He used the Thousand-Faces Mask
to play two roles.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.110
That man had evil intentions all along.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.110
I found an opportunity to poison

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.230
that evil person to death,

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.510
and then used his power
as a stepping stone.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.550
I'm not the only one

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.410
who's changed in our Xiao family.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.320
Xiao Qiushui has changed as well.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.340
It's just that
he became a cold-hearted, selfish person

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.490
who only cares about playing the hero.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:51.670
Yiren,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.410
you should understand this

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.000
better than I do.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.510
I've been carefully planning
for the Xiao family,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.490
but what has Qiushui

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920
been doing?

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.490
All he thinks about is
how to obtain divine skills

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.660
and how to build his own power base

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.260
to suppress you, Yiren.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.620
Otherwise,

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.450
why would he deceive you

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.760
about the Hero Command Token
and the Infinite Pill,

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.800
why would he leave the Xiao family

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.630
to form the so-called
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood,

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.430
and why would he get entangled with
the Power Gang,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.280
our Xiao family's enemy?

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:34.960
How can you only trust him

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.420
and not me, Yiren?

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:41.840
Shut up!

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:44.400
Then tell me

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.730
why you approached
the Northern Wastelanders!

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.450
Our Xiao family's forces are weak,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.180
and His Majesty has no desire to
go to war with the Northern Wasteland.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.570
If we follow His Majesty's wishes...

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.340
What do those empty rumors

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.530
in the martial world matter

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.460
compared to me restoring the Xiao family?
