WEBVTT

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:08.808
Hikaru has been really busy
since becoming Tohko Miyoshi's assistant.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.477
Why are you with Kurotaki?

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.547
Only insecure men get jealous,
you hear me?

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.882
You want to try harder?

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.251
Then should you be partying now?

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.487
How did things come to this?

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.457
INCOMING CALL

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.728
Hey, it's me.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:33.700
- What? Why are you--
- Do you remember what you said to me once?

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.535
What?

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.070
About Haruka.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:40.006
You'd better cherish her.
I'll kill you if you hurt her.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.143
That's rich.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.512
You better come get her.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.280
Or else

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.283
I'm taking her back.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.992
Over my dead body!

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:00.693
Hikaru?

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:04.964
Wow.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:07.333
You're so loved.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.470
I'll kill you.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.339
I mean, each other.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.011
Okay, I'm off then.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:18.945
Later.

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:24.184
Um…

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.986
- Sorry for what I said.
- No, no.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:28.955
Me too.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.658
I need to apologize too.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.094
But

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.062
before that.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.501
I love you, Hikaru!

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.108
I definitely love you more.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.745
It doesn't matter how many times we fight,
as long as I feel like this.

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.115
He's the only one I want to be with.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.857
Thanks for the bath.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.358
Sure.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.831
You seem stiff. Are you nervous?

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.467
Of course I am.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.403
We don't have to do anything.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.439
No, I want to.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:22.876
Look.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.514
Here.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.251
Can I open it?

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.823
I was going to give this to you
on our date.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.927
To remind you of me when we're apart.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:47.300
It's so cute!

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:49.536
Let me do it.

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.547
No way! It fits perfectly!

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.386
Sorry for making you feel lonely.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.557
Did you start working for Mio

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.860
because I've been busy?

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:19.933
That's part of it.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.905
But it's also me wanting to match
the hard work you're putting in.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.243
I don't want you to leave me behind.

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.312
I'd never do that.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:37.217
I want to be someone who belongs with you.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:41.387
I want to become the version of me
who can be by your side.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:46.726
But I end up thinking about you
all the time.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.330
That's crazy, right?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.468
What are you grinning about?

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.975
If you're crazy, I'm even crazier.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.443
Huh?

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:08.181
Do you know why lovers give rings?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.690
It's a bond.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.760
I want you all to myself.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.902
Just keep thinking only about me.

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.583
Are you scared?

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.021
I'm not.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.992
What scares me

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.729
is how I only care about you.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:12.245
Hey, let's make a bucket list
of things to do together.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.279
COUPLE BUCKET LIST

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.347
Good idea.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.481
That sounds fun.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:16.883
TRAVEL WITH OVERNIGHT STAY

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.017
LIVE TOGETHER

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:19.786
5 YEARS LATER

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.689
It means applying makeup to your soul,
not your face.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.691
Makeup to your soul?

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.994
While makeup changes your appearance
to build confidence,

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.830
the magic ends when you take it off.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.734
I don't want to use makeup
like it's armor.

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:38.871
He was able to go independent
in only five years. That's our Hikaru!

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:42.875
He said he couldn't have done it
without your support, you know?

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.413
I mean, our company also benefits
from working with him.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.151
You've also changed over the past years.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.589
I can't believe I'm working
for a cosmetics company.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:59.459
It never would've happened
if I hadn't met Hikaru.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:03.996
Being a different version
of your usual self by wearing makeup

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:08.201
can become like your good luck charm.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.675
How do you get those long lashes?

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.377
Or that radiant skin!

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:20.313
I have no confidence.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.715
I want to be able to like myself.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.493
I truly believe that makeup
can profoundly influence a person's life.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.833
To me, a beautiful person

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.302
is anyone who is confident.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:48.541
I want to apply makeup to their soul
to draw out their inner beauty.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:50.576
And

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.415
have them realize the beauty
they had all along.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.333
That's my job.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.136
Let's ask one final question for…

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.204
I'm home.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.739
Welcome home.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.709
- Keep it on.
- Huh?

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:27.313
What's important is to know yourself.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.151
While people around you
may not understand you,

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:36.289
you'll find your path
if you keep moving forward.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.491
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:43.196
This has been a live broadcast
from Hikaru Makeup Salon.

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:45.832
Thank you, Mr. Hikaru Kamiyama.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.569
I was so nervous.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.570
Yeah, right.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:52.839
"That's my job."

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.075
I didn't pose like that.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.080
But it was a good interview.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:05.351
I'm happy you're getting recognition.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.855
But as you know,

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:10.957
he tends to lose his nerve.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.826
Too scared to leave his comfort zone.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.329
Make sure you stay on him.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.732
Who do you think you are?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.971
I had no idea what you were thinking
for the longest time, Shu.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:28.608
But you really care about Hikaru a lot.

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:33.579
Actually, there was a time when
I thought you hated me.

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:37.483
I could never hate the person
Hikaru cares about.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:43.723
I'll keep trying to be someone
worthy of Hikaru.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.958
Please take care of him.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:51.097
You know, are you guys
not thinking about marriage yet?

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:54.534
- Oh…
- It's still a bit early for marriage!

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:56.536
What?

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.871
We need to focus on our careers,

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:01.574
so marriage is still far down the line.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.710
I see.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:09.982
I'm sure Hikaru wants to focus on
the business he just started.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.618
I don't want to pressure him.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.022
So I'm happy just to be together for now.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:22.328
Well,

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:23.863
good luck.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.973
What?! Not thinking about marriage?

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.209
Of course she'd dump you for that!

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.346
Not yet! I told her
I'm not thinking about marriage yet!

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.015
I met her three months ago!

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.619
You're still so clueless, Keisuke.

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:47.587
How so?!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:54.860
Women are always doing the math
inside their head.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:09:59.532
If she wants a baby by 30,

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.200
she'd want to get married by 28.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.670
But if you have to date a while first,

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.340
you start thinking about marriage
around 25, 26.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:08.841
Totally reasonable!

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.377
Good point.

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:16.349
So do you think about marriage then?

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:17.249
Huh?

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.753
That's none of your business.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.687
Of course it is.

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:24.757
If you're unhappy, I feel hurt as well.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.030
I keep telling you!
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.599
Honestly!

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.937
- Excuse me, could I get another?
- Certainly.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:39.739
- Really?!
- Huh?

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:42.441
Did you want to leave?

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.011
Are you kidding me?

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.948
- Long time no see, Haruka!
- Long time no see!

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.583
Your coworker?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.585
Yeah, we're coming from an event.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.153
I missed you.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.322
It's my last month here.

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.223
Oh?

00:10:58.891 --> 00:10:59.859
Ta-da!

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.197
Sorry for having lucked out!

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:09.101
I'm so happy you're happy!

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.336
Dang it!

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.038
Beer and skewers on me.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.105
Yay!

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.674
Not that I own this place.

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:16.776
Excuse me!

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.344
- Two beers!
- Okay.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.880
- Boss, two beers!
- Okay!

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.215
But really, congratulations.

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.618
You've been with Hikaru
a long time, right?

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.787
Isn't it about time?

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:28.854
For marriage!

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.757
I'm not so sure.

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.125
Look at you blush!

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.227
Just do it!

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:36.629
Right.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.164
You just gotta go for it.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.234
It's been five years, huh?

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.206
I'll do your hair and makeup tomorrow.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.808
Really?

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.644
It's our five-year anniversary.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.413
I'm the one who makes you the prettiest.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:16.602
Have a seat.

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:24.443
I just remembered the first day
you cast your magic on me.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.078
Come on, sit down.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.715
I'll cast a spell on you.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.720
Your spell changed my life.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.457
I was just the trigger.

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:42.228
You changed your life by yourself.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:13:00.212
This color matches you and your outfit
the best today.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.582
Wow, you considered all that for me?

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:05.718
I'm a professional, after all.

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.225
Such a pretty color.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.427
- Thank you.
- Of course.

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:19.331
Sorry, I'll try to finish up
as soon as I can.

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.101
- Please look forward to it.
- Okay.

00:13:26.605 --> 00:13:27.740
Welcome.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:31.510
I'm here to pick up the personalized gift.

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.445
One moment, please.

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:40.653
This should be the one.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.589
Please look it over.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.525
It's so beautiful!

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:52.364
The more it's used,
the more it gains character.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:53.299
Right.

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:55.367
I'm sure he'll love it.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.736
He's late.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.882
HARUKA FUKUNAGA

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.051
The number you've called…

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.728
A truck drove onto the sidewalk.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:58.364
They said a young man was taken
to the hospital.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.132
Hospital?

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:04.069
Hikaru?

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:14.480
Wait, do they only allow family
to come into the hospital?

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.750
Do I have to be family to be with him?

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.163
Haruka?

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.066
Sorry I'm late.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:41.473
What's wrong?

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:43.976
Let's get married.

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:45.177
Hikaru.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:49.448
I don't want to feel like this again.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:53.686
I can't think of a life without you!

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:55.955
Let's get married right now!

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:02.428
Thank you for reserving
the entire restaurant.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:13.305
Since you managed to ask me out first,

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.041
I wanted to beat you this time.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:21.180
{\an8}Why did you have to say it first again?

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.716
{\an8}Here.

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.519
{\an8}Open it.

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:29.555
{\an8}Okay.

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.433
Wow!

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.635
Are they real glass slippers?

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:47.106
Wait.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.043
I WANT TO WEAR A CINDERELLA DRESS
CAN'T DRAW GLASS SLIPPERS

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:57.082
{\an8}How did you even remember this?

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:06.658
{\an8}I wanted to be the prince,
not the fairy godmother, Haruka.

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:13.866
{\an8}But I can't be all manly either.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.101
{\an8}Not that I want to.

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.038
{\an8}Hence this awkward proposal.

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:25.010
{\an8}I always end up looking silly
in front of you.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.217
{\an8}But, Haruka…

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:36.288
{\an8}you always face me head-on.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.758
It made me love myself.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.952
I may not be a very cool prince,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.322
but I want you by my side.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:15.928
What do you mean?

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:20.432
You're a prince who can use magic.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.403
Is there anyone cooler than that?

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.979
Will you marry me?

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:44.790
Yes.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:09.715
I've learned to love myself
thanks to your magic.

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:20.025
I can handle anything if I'm with you.

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:30.502
Because being together makes me happy.

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.517
{\an8}STRAWBERRY PICKING
PLAY BASKETBALL

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.085
{\an8}GET MARRIED!

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.755
