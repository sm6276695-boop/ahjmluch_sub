00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:42.544
A woman

00:01:43.304 --> 00:01:45.904
who was once the poison in my veins...

00:01:57.164 --> 00:01:58.624
turns into the love

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:02.264
that my heart could never beat without.

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:52.064
Seems like you didn't learn from last time.

00:02:52.224 --> 00:02:54.934
If you ever think about
using your power against me,

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:56.664
just know it's not gonna work.

00:02:57.024 --> 00:02:59.944
I'll expose all your dirty little habits.

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:01.344
I dare you.

00:03:01.804 --> 00:03:03.984
Are you sure
you're gonna mess with someone like me?

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:06.504
You know all too well who I am.

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:09.024
With just a snap of my fingers,
your life will be ruined!

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.784
It's your life that will be ruined.

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.744
What a shameless home wrecker.

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.344
You won't shut up, huh?!

00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:17.364
Anyone who dares to challenge me

00:03:17.544 --> 00:03:20.584
is either in a coma or dead.

00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:21.744
You decide!

00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:30.264
Scalpel.

00:03:33.344 --> 00:03:34.504
Bovie forceps.

00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:42.264
Apply pressure.

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:43.624
Artery clamp.

00:03:47.384 --> 00:03:48.504
Push Heparin.

00:03:48.544 --> 00:03:49.864
Heparin is in.

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.544
Insert the arterial cannula.

00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:54.064
Secure the line.

00:03:58.704 --> 00:03:59.624
Pump on.

00:03:59.664 --> 00:04:00.744
Connect the pump.

00:04:04.824 --> 00:04:05.984
He's now on pump.

00:04:06.144 --> 00:04:07.584
Everyone, you can relax.

00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:21.384
The patient is stable now.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:23.504
The surgery went well.

00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:26.134
Though, I'd like to keep him in the ICU

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:27.624
for close observation.

00:04:29.784 --> 00:04:32.384
We could never
thank you enough, Dr. Premsinee.

00:04:32.944 --> 00:04:34.624
Thank you very much.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.984
Thank you, Doctor, for saving my dad.

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:37.824
Thank you.

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:42.224
It's gonna be fine.

00:04:44.224 --> 00:04:45.224
Dad's fine now, sweetie.

00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:50.504
Cut!

00:04:50.544 --> 00:04:51.544
End slate.

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:54.504
Cut three, take one.

00:04:55.944 --> 00:04:57.544
Pat, you did such a great job.

00:04:57.564 --> 00:04:59.294
You delivered the emotions really well.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:02.374
Of course, look at
the fantastic teamwork we have.

00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:04.864
Let's take a lunch break
and run through the lines after.

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.474
That was an amazing scene, you two.

00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:10.104
After the break, let's do the drama scene.

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:11.184
Of course.

00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:12.704
Thank you!

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:16.304
- Here's your phone.
- Thank you!

00:05:16.844 --> 00:05:17.404
Pat!

00:05:23.844 --> 00:05:24.844
Nam!

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:32.404
Wait a second.

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:34.504
Shouldn't the manager
be the one taking care of her actress?

00:05:35.484 --> 00:05:37.744
It's not every day
you come visit me on set.

00:05:37.864 --> 00:05:39.264
Gotta give you special treatment.

00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.624
If you keep this up,

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:45.724
I'd be so spoiled
I wouldn't know how to lift a finger.

00:05:46.484 --> 00:05:47.344
That's even better.

00:05:47.544 --> 00:05:49.344
That way
you won't be able to live without me.

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:53.014
Here.

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.184
Nam, what's wrong?

00:05:58.904 --> 00:06:00.904
The restaurant
probably put too much cheese in.

00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:02.074
The smell's too strong.

00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:03.814
They did?

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:06.904
What do you wanna eat, then?
I'll order it.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:08.104
Let me take care of it.

00:06:08.274 --> 00:06:09.444
It's fine, Pat.

00:06:09.834 --> 00:06:11.634
I'm actually not that hungry.

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:13.324
You go ahead and eat.

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:15.954
Nam, are you sick?

00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:30.574
You don't feel hot, though.

00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:34.624
No, I'm fine.

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.194
Nam,

00:06:38.404 --> 00:06:39.824
I'm worried about you.

00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:41.374
If you don't feel your best,

00:06:41.404 --> 00:06:43.104
you need to tell me.

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:44.364
No secrets,

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:45.384
you understand?

00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:48.814
Mm, I do.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.424
Pinky promise.

00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:55.904
Mm,

00:06:57.024 --> 00:06:58.024
pinky promise.

00:06:59.864 --> 00:07:02.024
Isn't Prem already done with the surgery?

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:03.574
How come she isn't here by now?

00:07:04.074 --> 00:07:05.174
Right?

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:07.784
We've been waiting forever.

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:08.624
- Hm...
- Wait,

00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.034
how many cases does she have?

00:07:10.244 --> 00:07:11.344
I don't know.

00:07:11.584 --> 00:07:12.704
I'm starving.

00:07:13.854 --> 00:07:15.254
What are you two gossiping about?

00:07:19.414 --> 00:07:21.954
You've never changed
from your med school years a bit.

00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:24.274
- Hi, Professor.
- Hello, Professor.

00:07:24.294 --> 00:07:25.024
Mm...

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:26.864
We're not gossiping,

00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:28.534
just waiting for Prem.

00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:29.354
Hm...

00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:30.874
Look,

00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:32.424
there she is.

00:07:35.424 --> 00:07:36.764
Hi, Professor.

00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:37.794
Hi, there.

00:07:38.714 --> 00:07:39.384
Right,

00:07:39.744 --> 00:07:41.054
congratulations, Prem.

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:43.064
I've got the invitation.

00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:44.904
Thank you, Professor.

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.624
See you at the ceremony.

00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:48.904
See you there.

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:51.434
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.504
Focus on your work.

00:07:53.984 --> 00:07:55.094
Roger that.

00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:57.124
- I'm leaving.
- Bye, Professor.

00:07:58.904 --> 00:07:59.624
Hey,

00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:02.704
You really take after Professor Tik!

00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:04.704
Not to mention Sita.

00:08:04.744 --> 00:08:05.594
How?

00:08:05.904 --> 00:08:07.264
Well, she has the sweetest face

00:08:07.604 --> 00:08:09.264
but is high-key brutal!

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:12.264
Are you talking about me, Bow?

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:16.664
Nope, Sita.

00:08:16.704 --> 00:08:18.424
I'd never gossip about you.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.664
I'm missing you, that's all.

00:08:20.754 --> 00:08:22.034
You thought you were smooth?

00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:28.874
Are you ready for your bachelorette party,

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.124
bride-to-be?

00:08:30.184 --> 00:08:32.954
We actually don't need the party, you know?

00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:34.984
We do!

00:08:35.024 --> 00:08:37.824
Leaving the single club
deserves a celebration,

00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:38.944
right, Sita?

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:40.704
Yes, it definitely does.

00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:42.184
- Let's roll!
- Let's do it.

00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:42.984
Alright.

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:58.304
Let's go!

00:08:58.594 --> 00:08:59.624
Not leaving unless we're drunk!

00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:01.344
Bring it on!

00:09:01.384 --> 00:09:02.824
Be a good girl today, alright?

00:09:02.864 --> 00:09:04.344
Let's get Sita drunk, then.

00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:05.544
You're cooked!

00:09:05.984 --> 00:09:06.624
Oops.

00:09:10.964 --> 00:09:12.584
Don't be shy tonight, bride-to-be.

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:14.864
Go all out today, girl.

00:09:20.744 --> 00:09:22.824
There's still space. Keep backing up.

00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:24.224
Keep going.

00:09:24.704 --> 00:09:25.984
Keep going, keep going.

00:09:26.384 --> 00:09:27.544
Just a bit more.

00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:28.824
There!

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:53.984
Ticha.

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:06.944
Could you please remove those glasses?

00:10:07.344 --> 00:10:08.864
People are staring.

00:10:09.464 --> 00:10:11.424
Didn't you say
you didn't want to be recognized?

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:13.024
When you're this standout,

00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:14.664
there's no way they don't recognize you.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.544
I just don't wanna meet the paparazzi.

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:18.264
Pat, don't be.

00:10:18.304 --> 00:10:19.864
This is Win's club;

00:10:19.904 --> 00:10:21.264
there's no way something will leak.

00:10:21.624 --> 00:10:22.624
Plus,

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.664
they vet people before they come in.

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:29.404
I'm just so sick of them

00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:32.304
shipping me with male actors.

00:10:32.344 --> 00:10:33.664
Do you wanna just tell them

00:10:33.704 --> 00:10:36.224
that you're actually into women,

00:10:36.524 --> 00:10:38.204
but the reason you wouldn't date anyone

00:10:38.234 --> 00:10:40.464
because you're foolishly into your friend?

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:44.664
It's time
you start aiming for other people,

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:46.184
not just Nam.

00:11:46.504 --> 00:11:47.184
Hey!

00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:48.304
I saw that.

00:11:48.824 --> 00:11:49.604
Saw what?

00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:50.834
Good start!

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:52.604
Look around all you want

00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:53.634
at these girls.

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:01.464
She's gorgeous, isn't she?

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.344
Go ask her out.

00:12:03.664 --> 00:12:04.984
I'll ask her for her number.

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:05.944
Stop!

00:12:07.384 --> 00:12:08.584
Sit back down!

00:12:22.344 --> 00:12:24.424
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:26.764
To Prem's bachelorette party!

00:12:26.794 --> 00:12:29.434
- Yay.
- Yay!

00:12:31.614 --> 00:12:34.094
Tan, why in the world are you crying?!

00:12:34.394 --> 00:12:36.194
This is a party, not a funeral!

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.914
I can't help the lump in my throat!

00:12:38.144 --> 00:12:40.304
It's gonna be lonely without you.

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:42.354
Even though I'm getting married,

00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:45.304
I'm still gonna be with you guys.

00:12:46.904 --> 00:12:50.104
Didn't you say
Prem deserves someone on her side?

00:12:50.674 --> 00:12:52.314
I'm just touched, Sita,

00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:54.424
that my friend will soon be a bride.

00:12:54.894 --> 00:12:56.144
A little jealous, too.

00:12:56.624 --> 00:12:58.504
You want the wedding gown for yourself?

00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:00.664
Hey, don't be such a know-it-all.

00:13:05.484 --> 00:13:07.824
At the altar on your wedding day,

00:13:07.904 --> 00:13:11.384
the host will definitely ask you
how you met the groom

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:12.544
and when you fell in love.

00:13:12.674 --> 00:13:14.194
Wanna have a rehearsal now?

00:13:14.574 --> 00:13:15.644
That sounds lovely.

00:13:15.824 --> 00:13:17.784
A confidence boost for Prem.

00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:22.594
Well, let's start.

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:26.024
What makes you fall in love with the groom?

00:13:35.184 --> 00:13:36.064
Right this way.

00:13:42.794 --> 00:13:44.674
Here's your seat.

00:13:45.084 --> 00:13:45.944
Thank you.

00:13:47.624 --> 00:13:49.344
This restaurant is amazing, Prem.

00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:52.424
Thank you.

00:13:52.444 --> 00:13:53.384
Sweet Prem,

00:13:55.404 --> 00:13:56.304
big bite.

00:13:56.324 --> 00:13:57.164
Big, big bite.

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:09.344
Do you want me to give you a ride home?

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:10.164
Please.

00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:17.264
Because he's such a gentleman.

00:14:18.054 --> 00:14:19.154
Ugh...

00:14:20.444 --> 00:14:21.444
That's it?

00:14:22.274 --> 00:14:24.184
He's very consistent.

00:14:24.624 --> 00:14:26.304
He's still the person I first met

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:29.184
after five years together.

00:14:29.384 --> 00:14:31.744
He puts me before himself,

00:14:32.264 --> 00:14:34.074
respects my family and me,

00:14:34.134 --> 00:14:36.374
takes care, and pays attention to me.

00:14:36.994 --> 00:14:38.094
Boo,

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.784
that's so cliche!

00:14:40.824 --> 00:14:43.344
Can we have something more iconic?

00:14:44.594 --> 00:14:45.524
How?

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:48.474
Like, the way he makes your heart race

00:14:48.504 --> 00:14:50.584
or the way he becomes
someone you can't live without.

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:52.184
Those kinds of things.
Can't you think of one?

00:14:52.334 --> 00:14:53.234
Well,

00:14:56.494 --> 00:14:57.874
he treats me the best.

00:14:58.524 --> 00:14:59.664
Do you love him?

00:15:03.464 --> 00:15:05.784
Bow, that's a weird thing to ask.

00:15:06.084 --> 00:15:07.944
She definitely does.

00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:15.184
That's true, Sita.

00:15:15.344 --> 00:15:16.814
Bow, that was nonsense.

00:15:17.504 --> 00:15:19.004
Come on, don't be such a party pooper.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:21.034
No poopers are allowed tonight!

00:15:21.324 --> 00:15:22.144
Ahem,

00:15:22.684 --> 00:15:23.784
Doctors,

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:27.224
our girl is getting closer
to becoming a bride after tonight.

00:15:27.624 --> 00:15:30.504
Let's toast to Dr. Premsinee.

00:15:30.544 --> 00:15:32.074
Bottoms up!

00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:34.824
Bottoms up!

00:15:55.864 --> 00:15:56.464
Oops.

00:15:56.594 --> 00:15:57.474
Tan...

00:15:58.104 --> 00:15:59.624
Wow, look at you.

00:16:00.684 --> 00:16:02.354
I can't do this anymore.

00:16:02.464 --> 00:16:03.844
As you should.

00:16:03.884 --> 00:16:05.624
How many shots have you taken?

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.944
I wanna go home...

00:16:11.954 --> 00:16:14.034
Alright, alright.

00:16:14.184 --> 00:16:15.744
Wait for me here.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:16.904
Don't you move an inch.

00:16:16.944 --> 00:16:18.104
I'll find our friends.

00:16:18.524 --> 00:16:19.764
They took too damn long.

00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:21.424
Right, okay.

00:16:21.644 --> 00:16:23.144
- Mm.
- Mm, okay.

00:16:23.164 --> 00:16:24.444
Uh-huh..

00:16:24.944 --> 00:16:25.794
Don't move!

00:16:25.814 --> 00:16:26.924
- Mm!
- Gosh!

00:16:48.114 --> 00:16:49.674
You two were so busy flirting.

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:50.784
Prem is...

00:16:50.804 --> 00:16:51.564
Wait!

00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:54.624
I told her to wait here.

00:16:54.664 --> 00:16:55.744
Where the hell is she?

00:16:57.044 --> 00:16:58.304
Well, go find her!

00:16:58.324 --> 00:16:59.324
- Right, okay.
- Go!

00:17:02.944 --> 00:17:04.384
Where's Bow's car?

00:17:08.604 --> 00:17:10.004
Here you are!

00:17:56.914 --> 00:17:57.664
Huh...

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.264
you're completely careless.

00:18:21.344 --> 00:18:22.424
Miss?

00:18:24.504 --> 00:18:25.264
Miss?

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:32.384
Where the hell is she?

00:18:34.224 --> 00:18:35.544
We've looked everywhere!

00:18:35.984 --> 00:18:37.224
Where did she go?

00:18:37.404 --> 00:18:39.104
Don't tell me someone took her.

00:18:39.344 --> 00:18:39.974
Well,

00:18:40.004 --> 00:18:41.204
call her!

00:18:41.244 --> 00:18:42.394
Call her now!

00:18:56.954 --> 00:18:58.034
We're screwed.

00:18:59.424 --> 00:19:00.304
Miss...

00:19:01.364 --> 00:19:02.364
Miss!

00:19:02.744 --> 00:19:03.744
Miss!

00:19:05.904 --> 00:19:07.364
You're really drunk.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:11.274
I guess there's no choice.

00:19:12.024 --> 00:19:13.344
I'll take you home.

00:20:18.704 --> 00:20:20.864
Do you see a woman with long hair...

00:20:21.704 --> 00:20:22.704
It's all because of you, Bow.

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:24.844
I told you to hurry back to Prem,

00:20:25.064 --> 00:20:26.264
but you keep pushing me back.

00:20:26.484 --> 00:20:29.584
I didn't know
she was gonna disappear like this!

00:20:34.864 --> 00:20:36.864
He said he saw Prem walking outside.

00:20:37.264 --> 00:20:37.904
What?

00:20:37.944 --> 00:20:39.104
Where could she possibly be?!

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:41.024
She didn't get into the wrong car, did she?

00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:44.984
Will she strip tonight?

00:20:46.584 --> 00:20:47.984
What do you think?

00:20:48.024 --> 00:20:50.864
With that much drinking,
will she strip?

00:20:56.944 --> 00:20:57.864
What are you doing?

00:20:59.054 --> 00:20:59.934
Miss?

00:21:01.474 --> 00:21:02.394
Miss!

00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:03.984
What are you doing?!

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.504
Hey, where are you going?

00:21:16.524 --> 00:21:18.284
Let go of me. I'm hot.

00:21:18.724 --> 00:21:19.564
You!

00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:20.554
Where are you going?

00:21:20.584 --> 00:21:22.714
Leave me alone!

00:21:23.284 --> 00:21:24.344
Miss!

00:21:24.614 --> 00:21:26.254
Ugh, don't touch me!

00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:29.214
Miss...

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:33.944
I'm cold.

00:21:34.954 --> 00:21:35.694
What?

00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:37.704
You just said you were hot.

00:21:38.584 --> 00:21:39.724
I'm cold...

00:22:05.275 --> 00:22:06.275
I wanna go to bed...

00:22:06.615 --> 00:22:07.715
Hey, Miss!

00:22:08.915 --> 00:22:10.115
Miss!

00:23:20.955 --> 00:23:22.195
Did you just pass out?

00:23:44.135 --> 00:23:46.195
This is for stealing my bed.

00:23:48.115 --> 00:23:50.635
Wonder how shocked you'd be
by this mark.

00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:14.395
What happened?

00:24:31.915 --> 00:24:33.115
Last night,

00:24:34.035 --> 00:24:35.795
I got into Bow's car...

00:24:36.755 --> 00:24:38.595
How did I get here?

00:24:43.435 --> 00:24:44.755
What is this place?

00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:24.225
"Last night, you got in the wrong car

00:25:24.475 --> 00:25:26.365
while very drunk.

00:25:26.475 --> 00:25:29.105
Don't remove your clothes
in front of anyone like that again."

00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:34.115
Thank you,

00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:36.005
Angel,

00:25:37.675 --> 00:25:39.195
for not taking advantage of me.

00:25:41.675 --> 00:25:42.505
Prem,

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.795
what happened last night?

00:25:44.835 --> 00:25:45.675
Spill.

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:47.705
Yeah.

00:25:48.555 --> 00:25:49.395
Nothing happened.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:51.955
Sit back down!

00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:54.805
Don't even think about lying.

00:25:55.115 --> 00:25:57.755
Yeah, there's no way nothing happened.

00:25:58.195 --> 00:25:59.715
You were so drunk last night, Prem.

00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.355
We were so worried!

00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:03.515
I told you to wait,
and you wouldn't listen.

00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:05.035
You just walked out with a straight face!

00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:08.315
I couldn't wait any longer last night.

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:10.715
So, what really happened?

00:26:11.235 --> 00:26:13.115
And don't you dare say nothing did.

00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.315
- We don't buy it!
- We don't buy it!

00:26:14.955 --> 00:26:16.195
Uh...

00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:18.915
I...

00:26:20.195 --> 00:26:20.995
I...

00:26:27.125 --> 00:26:28.475
I got in the wrong car!

00:26:28.835 --> 00:26:29.835
- That's it?
- That's it?

00:26:31.975 --> 00:26:33.235
There's no way on earth.

00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:35.325
Tell us, now!

00:26:37.555 --> 00:26:39.555
The car's owner took me to sleep
at their condo.

00:26:39.955 --> 00:26:40.955
- Sleep?
- Sleep?

00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:44.355
Just sleep!

00:26:44.675 --> 00:26:45.955
They seem like a nice one.

00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:47.385
They didn't take advantage of me at all.

00:26:49.355 --> 00:26:50.115
Prem,

00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:51.995
are you sure they didn't...

00:26:52.035 --> 00:26:53.675
- Like, uh...
- Mm.

00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:54.955
do the deeds with you.

00:26:55.185 --> 00:26:56.185
I am!

00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:58.045
I'm a doctor.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:01.465
How could I not know
what happened to my body?

00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:03.995
If that's the case, then you're lucky.

00:27:04.035 --> 00:27:05.995
If they were someone evil,
you'd be screwed.

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:31.675
My necklace is gone...

00:27:34.835 --> 00:27:36.315
Instead, there's this mark on me.

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:39.195
I just knew they were a good person.

00:27:41.035 --> 00:27:42.675
But is it a he or a she?

00:27:43.035 --> 00:27:45.915
I'm...not sure.

00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:47.875
I think it's a she.

00:27:49.475 --> 00:27:50.185
Why?

00:27:50.215 --> 00:27:50.815
Girl,

00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:52.265
think about it.

00:27:52.355 --> 00:27:55.315
If it were a man,
Prem wouldn't be this lucky.

00:27:55.735 --> 00:27:56.735
You're right.

00:28:00.995 --> 00:28:02.155
Are you completely sure?

00:28:05.355 --> 00:28:07.115
I am! Nothing's happened!

00:28:09.955 --> 00:28:11.155
That's odd.

00:28:16.475 --> 00:28:17.475
Nam!

00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:20.795
Nam, I bought you some food!

00:28:20.815 --> 00:28:22.175
Your favorite!

00:28:25.335 --> 00:28:26.335
Nam?

00:28:31.995 --> 00:28:32.675
Pat?

00:28:34.515 --> 00:28:35.635
You're here?

00:28:38.715 --> 00:28:39.475
Wait,

00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:42.075
are you alright?

00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:44.115
Why...

00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:46.635
do you look so unwell?

00:28:48.175 --> 00:28:49.095
Yeah,

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.285
I'm okay.

00:28:54.015 --> 00:28:55.775
You said that yesterday,

00:28:56.215 --> 00:28:57.795
yet you didn't get any better.

00:28:57.835 --> 00:28:59.465
I should take you to the doctor.

is you're the woman I love the most.

00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:05.317
The woman you love the most?

00:44:07.957 --> 00:44:10.957
Then, why did you
get someone else pregnant?!

00:44:12.277 --> 00:44:13.557
That woman

00:44:14.157 --> 00:44:17.557
had her friend demand
her baby's father back at our wedding!

00:44:18.267 --> 00:44:20.907
I don't even know where to put myself!

00:44:20.937 --> 00:44:21.997
Calm down, Prem.

00:44:22.197 --> 00:44:23.477
I didn't do it!

00:44:23.917 --> 00:44:25.277
Listen to me, Prem.

00:44:26.357 --> 00:44:27.077
Prem,

00:44:27.877 --> 00:44:28.907
listen.

00:44:31.557 --> 00:44:32.797
Someone impersonated me

00:44:33.357 --> 00:44:34.637
with bad intention.

00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:38.437
You gotta believe me!

00:44:40.397 --> 00:44:41.077
Prem...

00:44:41.597 --> 00:44:42.637
Please.

00:44:43.477 --> 00:44:44.397
Prem...

00:44:46.787 --> 00:44:48.147
That's your business, not mine.

00:44:49.717 --> 00:44:51.357
But as for our wedding,

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:53.367
I'm not willing to proceed!

00:44:53.597 --> 00:44:54.957
Prem, why...

00:44:54.997 --> 00:44:55.837
Prem!

00:44:57.077 --> 00:44:57.917
Father!

00:44:58.277 --> 00:45:00.877
How could you run away
from your own wedding?

00:45:00.897 --> 00:45:02.697
Go back to the ceremony at once, Prem!

00:45:02.837 --> 00:45:04.117
I won't, Father.

00:45:04.517 --> 00:45:06.277
You're ruining our reputation!

00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:09.607
But it's not my fault!

00:45:09.637 --> 00:45:11.077
There's no chance I'm getting married!

00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:12.317
Prem!

00:45:12.557 --> 00:45:13.317
Thawat,

00:45:14.037 --> 00:45:14.957
just leave for now.

00:45:15.237 --> 00:45:16.707
Let us talk to her.

00:45:26.237 --> 00:45:27.157
Prem,

00:45:27.327 --> 00:45:29.567
can we wait until after the ceremony?

00:45:31.197 --> 00:45:32.137
Mother...

00:45:33.127 --> 00:45:34.747
If you ever caught...

00:45:35.427 --> 00:45:37.227
Father cheating,

00:45:38.637 --> 00:45:40.677
would you carry on with the wedding?

00:45:45.017 --> 00:45:47.177
I'm sorry, Father, Mother,

00:45:48.117 --> 00:45:50.157
that I embarrassed you,

00:45:52.737 --> 00:45:56.737
but I can't force myself
to marry a betrayer.

00:45:58.497 --> 00:46:00.337
Alright, dear.

00:46:01.197 --> 00:46:03.197
I'm not gonna force you.

00:46:03.597 --> 00:46:05.397
It's all gonna be fine, Prem.

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:07.157
It's okay.

00:46:12.897 --> 00:46:14.417
It's okay, dear.

00:46:17.817 --> 00:46:19.077
Take it easy.

00:46:19.097 --> 00:46:20.947
It's alright, dear.

00:46:24.197 --> 00:46:25.197
Take it easy.

00:46:36.437 --> 00:46:37.207
Nam!

00:46:41.537 --> 00:46:42.297
Nam!

00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:45.307
Thawat!

00:46:46.107 --> 00:46:47.627
You're here for me?

00:46:51.037 --> 00:46:51.797
Thawat!

00:46:53.517 --> 00:46:54.317
Thawat!

00:46:55.147 --> 00:46:56.717
You came for me?

00:46:56.737 --> 00:46:58.537
I'm so happy!

00:46:59.757 --> 00:47:00.877
What did you do?

00:47:02.767 --> 00:47:05.247
How dare you
send your friend to ruin my wedding?

00:47:05.277 --> 00:47:07.267
I don't have anything to do with that...

00:47:07.287 --> 00:47:08.287
Don't you lie to me!

00:47:08.817 --> 00:47:10.437
I'm not lying!

00:47:10.677 --> 00:47:12.237
I have no idea what you meant!

00:47:12.917 --> 00:47:14.277
I love you, Thawat.

00:47:14.377 --> 00:47:16.617
I would never hurt you for the world.

00:47:17.347 --> 00:47:20.157
Then, don't claim
that I'm the father of your child!

00:47:20.347 --> 00:47:22.357
But it's really yours!

00:47:22.437 --> 00:47:24.427
How could I know for sure?!

00:47:24.647 --> 00:47:27.237
I don't even know
who you've been sleeping with!

00:47:27.917 --> 00:47:28.837
Thawat!

00:47:29.157 --> 00:47:30.917
You're the only one I have.

00:47:31.597 --> 00:47:33.437
I truly love you, Thawat.

00:47:34.157 --> 00:47:36.027
I love you the most.

00:47:36.917 --> 00:47:37.637
Love?

00:47:39.597 --> 00:47:42.157
Do you love me,
or are you just trying to baby trap me?

00:47:42.937 --> 00:47:44.317
No one in this world

00:47:44.997 --> 00:47:46.677
would want you
to be the mother of their children.

00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:52.117
But I'm pregnant with your baby.

00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:55.077
If I can't be the mother of your baby,

00:47:55.797 --> 00:47:57.197
I'm getting an abortion.

00:47:57.877 --> 00:47:59.257
Are you threatening me?

00:47:59.277 --> 00:48:00.577
I'm not.

00:48:00.917 --> 00:48:02.237
Since I'm the mother,

00:48:02.477 --> 00:48:04.307
I can do whatever I want with it.

00:48:05.077 --> 00:48:07.007
If you don't want this baby,

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:09.517
then I see no worth in carrying it.

00:48:11.957 --> 00:48:13.197
Go take a paternity test, then!

00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.057
If it's really mine,

00:48:15.087 --> 00:48:16.287
I will pay for child support.

00:48:18.517 --> 00:48:19.887
But don't you even think

00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:22.117
I'm gonna make a wife out of you.

00:48:23.277 --> 00:48:24.597
Your kind of woman

00:48:24.877 --> 00:48:26.937
doesn't deserve someone like me.

00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:40.877
Why did you do this?

00:48:41.337 --> 00:48:43.097
Why didn't you say
something to me first?

00:48:43.597 --> 00:48:46.357
Because I knew that if I did,

00:48:46.397 --> 00:48:48.157
you certainly would've stopped me.

00:48:48.177 --> 00:48:49.537
So why did you still go on with it?

00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:51.557
Because he deserves it, Nam!

00:48:51.577 --> 00:48:53.457
He hurt two women at the same time;

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.277
not only does he hurt you,

00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.947
but he also hurts his girlfriend.

00:48:57.777 --> 00:48:59.897
You made him hate my guts!

00:49:00.197 --> 00:49:01.117
So what?

00:49:02.117 --> 00:49:04.197
You still care about that selfish being?

00:49:05.237 --> 00:49:07.477
I told you I love him

00:49:07.517 --> 00:49:08.917
and can't live without him!

00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:10.207
Don't you realize that?!

00:49:12.197 --> 00:49:13.637
So you're not coming to your senses?

00:49:14.047 --> 00:49:15.047
Coming to my senses?

00:49:16.457 --> 00:49:17.997
What are you even thinking, Pat?

00:49:18.657 --> 00:49:19.977
Didn't you say you love me?

00:49:20.447 --> 00:49:21.927
Didn't you say you understand?

00:49:22.797 --> 00:49:24.757
If so, why did you hurt me?!

00:49:28.077 --> 00:49:29.077
Nam,

00:49:30.557 --> 00:49:31.957
I did it all for you.

00:49:34.297 --> 00:49:36.657
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:39.437
I never asked you to do any of that.

00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:50.397
Alright,

00:49:51.627 --> 00:49:52.877
everything I did

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:56.197
is gonna be the last thing
I ever did for you.

00:49:57.917 --> 00:49:59.547
There won't be a next time.

00:50:01.887 --> 00:50:03.337
I'm sorry

00:50:04.787 --> 00:50:06.387
that I upset you, Nam.

00:50:10.157 --> 00:50:12.157
But I think I've done the right thing.

00:50:12.937 --> 00:50:14.367
Not only did I save you,

00:50:14.587 --> 00:50:17.437
but I also helped that woman
come to the realization.

00:50:18.907 --> 00:50:20.787
If Thawat doesn't come back to me,

00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:23.457
I'll never forgive you.

00:50:43.917 --> 00:50:44.757
What's up?

00:50:46.787 --> 00:50:47.907
Ticha,

00:50:51.167 --> 00:50:53.207
I think I'm doing the right thing

00:50:55.477 --> 00:50:57.437
by getting over her.
