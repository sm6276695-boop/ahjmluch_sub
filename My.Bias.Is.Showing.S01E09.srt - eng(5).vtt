[My Bias is Showing?!]

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.530
I was also confused about
why I can't let you go,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.280
so I thought about it for a long time.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.070
I like you.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.540
Just once.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.630
I think...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.800
I've fallen for you.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.930
Just once,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.240
can you smile like you did?

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.240
Saying you like me
when you were never sincere...

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.990
It may not be a big deal to you...

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.610
but it is to me.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.660
Let's pretend nothing happened between us.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.660
Aejoon-hyung, wait. Let me finish.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.670
I don't trust you anymore!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.520
And I'd never been sincere with you.

Yeah?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.890
Mr. Na.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.050
When will Mr. Choi Siyeol come back?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.460
He's not coming anymore
because you all did badly in the exam.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.910
Let's start the class.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.960
Open your books.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.050
Yes.

Page 69.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.770
Put that away.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.480
It's class time.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.200
Yes.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.329
Can love be defined in a sentence?

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.270
So I think love is like

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.680
a fish-shaped sweet bread.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.750
You're right.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.430
His warm and considerate care is just like

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.800
the warm winter snack.

he's really enjoying "Go! School Teacher."

Can you introduce
the next submission, Siyeol?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.420
Okay.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.780
This submission is from
the listener "Awesome."

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.440
"Hello."

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.530
"I'm an office worker in my 30s."

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.230
"I recently met someone"

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.610
"and started a sweet relationship."

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.310
"My heart flutters non-stop
when I'm with them."

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.120
"They can do no wrong in my eyes."

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.250
"It makes me think that
I've really met the one."

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.240
"But then, a problem surfaced."

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.690
"A problem because of me."

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.750
What's the problem?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.830
"I dated someone for a long time
before we broke up."

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.760
"When I'm happy with my current partner,"

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.659
"I'll suddenly think of my ex."

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.070
"Maybe it's because"

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.610
"my ex was"

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.770
"someone I met during tough times
and someone I hurt a lot."

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.890
"I know I don't like my ex anymore,"

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.200
"but I still feel guilty
toward my current partner."

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.380
"I wonder if I should
break up with them"

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.480
"and sort myself out first."

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.260
"Is the definition of love chaos?"

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.010
That's the end.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.520
What do you think, Siyeol?

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.910
I'm worried that what I say

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.610
will cause a controversy again.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.940
Please be careful with your words today.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.700
I don't want this show
to end anytime soon.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.340
Then, I'll try to tone it down.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.450
I think

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.080
it's rude to your current partner
if you're this confused

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.870
and still think about your ex.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.120
You mentioned that
you dated your ex for a long time.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.110
Maybe you jumped into a new relationship

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.580
before moving on from your last.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.770
Or maybe...

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.060
you still love your ex.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.800
You'll have to decide for yourself.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.060
Yes.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.570
You should make a decision soon
for the sake of your current partner.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.550
But...

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.750
Is that really love?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.520
What are you referring to?

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.690
I'm wondering if the way the listener was

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.430
bothered by their ex

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.940
is really out of love.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.800
"The person I hurt
when times were tough for me."

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.470
"When I'm happy, I think of them."

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.240
Maybe

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.409
it's a kind of guilt you feel

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.770
toward someone you hurt.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.370
Although everyone has
different definitions of love,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.870
guilt is not love.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.380
I hope you won't live in regret
after losing the person you love

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.560
because of an obsession out of guilt.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.710
It's not too late to

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.970
sit with your feelings
and figure out whom you really love.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.660
We hope you work things out.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.190
You'll be receiving a gift voucher
for your submission.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.040
Good job, everyone.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.870
Good job.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.420
-Good job.
-Good job.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.500
Bye.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.100
Jooha.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.030
What you just said...

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.850
Your love for me was...

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.300
an obsession.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.170
Do you have to put it like that?

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.580
You do know you've been
out of sorts lately, don't you?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.610
Be honest with yourself

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.540
about your feelings.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.140
Let him know how you truly feel

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.690
so you don't end up with regrets.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.360
Actually, I know that.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.040
But...

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.450
Too much time has passed already.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.330
Then keep at it
until you get through to him.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.630
Think about what you did.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.000
You deserve to suffer a little.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.050
Bye.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.020
Oh my goodness!

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.790
You scared me.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.150
What's that?

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.250
Choi Siyeol?

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.720
Just when I finally
fell asleep after days...

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.150
What is it? What do you want?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.150
It'd better be something big...

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.840
What's this?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.150
He was passed out drunk at our door.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.990
Take care of him yourself.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.890
I'm going to bed.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.730
W-Wait! Ji Kyusung!

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.130
You're just leaving him with me?

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.870
I'm tired from working overtime.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.270
Hey!

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.480
Has it been

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.790
a month since that day?

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.170
Just when I've finally
decided to move on...

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.850
Aejoon-hyung.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.190
What am I supposed to do
if you act like that?

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.920
Hey.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.390
Let's eat.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.450
Serves you right.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.990
Choi Siyeol, no longer on your high horse.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.000
Don't provoke me.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.540
I'm sorry.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.200
What?

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.200
I owe you an apology too.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.820
I misunderstood you.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.420
Wow, Choi Siyeol.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.280
I never thought
I'd hear your apology in this life.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.790
Tsk.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.620
You've grown up, kid. So mature now.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.950
Hey, I told you not to provoke me.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.200
By the way...

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.710
how has Aejoon-hyung been?

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.420
Na Aejoon?

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.810
[One week ago]

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.680
Listen!

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.140
From now on,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.410
I'm no longer his fan.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.700
It's all... your fault!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.560
Yeah, it's all my fault.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.600
I said I won't support A-One anymore!

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.210
Hey, hey!

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.320
[Last night]

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.610
My room's covered with his photos!

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.980
How can he sleep in my room?

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.070
Just come clean today
and tell him you're his fan—

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.370
Let's change rooms for today.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.100
Siyeol would be so creeped out
if he woke up in my room,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.210
like he's in some horror flick!

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.110
Gosh, I'm so tired.
[This morning]

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.650
Help Siyeol with his hangover
before he goes home.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.070
Why do I have to
help a scumbag with his hangover?

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.360
Don't you insult him!

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.070
Only I'm allowed to insult him!

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.830
Do you hear me?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.270
You little...

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.500
Oh, gosh. My ears hurt.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.430
Since you're already here,
make things clear—

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.840
either break up or get back together.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.640
But he doesn't believe

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.110
anything I say.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.300
What else can you do?

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.970
You can either give up

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.510
or...

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.880
you can keep trying
until he gets annoyed at you.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.400
I'd really be screwed
if he got annoyed at me.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.330
Also...

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.230
I've never been the clingy one
in a relationship,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.780
so I don't know how to do that.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.820
Seriously...

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.070
Let's eat.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.150
You two brats are really
a match made in heaven.

[Did Siyeol go home safely?]

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.610
I wouldn't mind seeing him a bit longer.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.260
No.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.780
I did the right thing.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.700
Out of sight, out of mind.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.210
It'll also help him...

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.160
I doubt we'll ever meet again.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.180
Wait...

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.980
Why are you here?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.290
Oh?

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.150
I just happened to pass by.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.080
What a co-in-ci-dence

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.800
to run into you.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.720
By the way,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.540
I didn't come here for you
yesterday or today.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.370
Don't be annoyed at me.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.010
Our dear Siyeol

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.640
should never venture into acting.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.930
If you're off work, d-do you want a ride?

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.590
I'll drop you off on the way.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.480
Well, you also took me in for a night.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.020
-To thank you—
-I'm good.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.890
W-Why?

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.650
J-Just get in.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.910
I was going to go straight
and turn right anyway!

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.360
Mr. Na!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.180
Aejoon-hyung!

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.530
Gosh, darn it.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.130

[Choi Siyeol]

What's with the video call?

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.390
What is it?

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.730
Hey, where are you?

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.480
Where could I be?
There's no work, so I'm at home.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.780
Uh, well, it's nothing much.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.890
Uh...

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.540
I want to discuss the outfit with you.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.060
What outfit?

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.300
By the way, uh,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.820
is someone next to you?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.590
Move the camera back,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.570
or... yes, tilt the camera a little.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.990
Are you kidding me?

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.730
If you want to see his face,
video-call him instead.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.650
He doesn't answer—

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.780
It's because he doesn't answer my calls.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.690
Aejoon-hyung.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.170
Are you listening?

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.570
Uh, I have something to say.

I miss you!

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.200
Hey, hang up.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.960
So, we've decided to
conclude it with Siyeol alone.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.260
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.200
It's all my fault.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.220
I told you it's not your fault.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:31.080
Also, that's not why
I asked to meet you today.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.590
Are you seeing anyone by any chance?

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.170
No... I'm not.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.000
That's perfect.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.690
A close friend of mine is producing
a reality dating show for non-celebrities.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.440
Would...

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.500
What's going on?

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.470
Why is there a sudden chill in the air?

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.790
What, are the windows open?

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.190
He's taken.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.220
Oh my goodness.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.780
Siyeol.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.520
When did you...

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.980
But we aren't shooting today.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.690
I'm telling you

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.100
Mr. Na Aejoon is seeing someone.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.510
Huh?

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.360
But he just said he's not.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.350
He will, soon.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.230
He will, soon?

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.550
He'll start seeing m—

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.540
I'm sorry.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.560
Sorry, Ms. Han.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.680
Give me a minute.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.300
Should I go on the show instead?

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.700
Are you crazy?

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.400
How could you say that to the producer—

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.470
I'm really sorry, Aejoon-hyung.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.420
Everything was my fault.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.590
I really don't want to hurt you,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.150
but I can't let you go. I...

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.670
I don't know what I should do.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.600
I admit that at the beginning,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.260
I didn't think much of it.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.880
But before I knew it,

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.410
I fell in love with your smile.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.060
Soon, you became
a lovely presence in my life.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.130
When I found out that I'd misunderstood

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.010
someone so kind and sweet like you...

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.780
it was too late.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.970
I'm sorry.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.510
I'm really sorry.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.320
I understand that you find me annoying.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.180
I don't know what I can say

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.920
to prove my sincerity to you,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.940
but looking back, you...

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.780
you're the one I've always loved,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.410
not Jooha.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.760
I'm really afraid of losing you.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.220
I don't know how to let you go. Just...

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.660
Just let me stay by your side.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.690
Siyeol.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.130
For now...

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.430
Mr. Na Aejoon, are you there?

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.920
Oh... Y-Yes.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.650
W-What is it?

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.460
Uh, nothing. Well...

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.400
Since I'm here,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.250
I thought I'd get your seal
on the revised contract.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.060
Oh... Sure. Let's talk outside.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.650
I'll be right out.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.570
Okay.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.000
Do you have work tonight?

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.990
Let's talk at my place later.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.140
[Na Aejoon]
[Come home later today.]

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.920
Things will finally settle down.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.710
I brought you back to show you these.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.230
What...

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.170
are all these?

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.300
To be honest,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.090
I was planning not to see you ever again.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.290
I don't want to trust you

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.980
nor hear what you have to say.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.320
I know.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.670
Even though I want to express my feelings,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.880
everything I say is pathetic.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.070
From your point of view,
it must be so ridiculous.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.600
I'm really sorry.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.660
But...

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.120
I've been a fan of A-One for many years.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.690
Since I work in a school,

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.300
I thought I should keep it a secret.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.640
It's also why I couldn't tell you

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.110
that I was living with Ji Kyusung.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.650
Aejoon-hyung.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.670
To be precise,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.880
I've liked you a lot...

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.790
since a long time ago.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.220
That's why.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.530
Since I really liked you and trusted you,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.290
the betrayal felt even greater.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.220
I stopped watching your performances
I watched all the time,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.110
and I got worried about you.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.780
Although I haven't forgiven you yet,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.980

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.480

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.050
I want you to know that
I've liked you for a long time.

Thank you.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.680
It's okay even if you don't forgive me.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.780
Thank you so much.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.900
I like you,

You don't know how happy I was
to hear that

you agreed to stay on the show.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.220
By the way, have you thought about
what I asked you last time?

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.110
About what?

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.120
About the reality dating show.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.320
What's the shooting schedule like?

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.680
I was so mad that I thought I shouldn't
confront you till the end, but...

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.940
You, come with me.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.760
The reporter Han Yeonsu
has been stalking me.

How about you just... move in with me?
