00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.079
It's a corpse uprising.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.200
Everyone, be careful.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.599
These corpses

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.599
are much stronger than the undead we faced before.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.480
Second Young Master, are you alright?

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.159
They're getting stronger.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.640
Senior Brother, if we don't finish this quickly,

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.680
we won't be able to hold on.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.560
I'm fine.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.879
I can still fight these monsters.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.680
A wise man knows when to retreat.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:55.319
Fall back!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.919
Could he be

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.520
Wang, the physician?

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.280
He was turned into a corpse.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.680
It's like catching a turtle in a jar.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.719
We were too careless.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.719
Undead or corpse, it doesn't matter.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.639
Charge out and leave no survivors!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.800
They're afraid of fire.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.520
Light the fire!

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.400
It's my injured leg that's slowing everyone down.

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.719
This isn't the time to talk about that.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.159
Is there any way out?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.159
Why are you asking me?

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.719
Because you're the Master's Wife.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:02.240
It's difficult.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.039
Strange...

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.159
What's that sound outside?

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.680
Why did they suddenly change direction?

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.719
Our reinforcements must have arrived.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.840
Why is there another group coming?

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.759
Now...

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.800
We're doomed.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.919
Why are there more undead?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.120
Hurry, go!

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.960
Go!

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:28.879
Master's Wife

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.839
Master's Wife

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.120
Burn her!

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.959
Burn this witch!

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.879
Witch!

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.480
Burn this witch!

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.680
Burn her! Burn her!

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.079
Burn this witch!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.399
She must be burned!

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.160
Burn her! Burn this witch!

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.600
Burn her!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.879
Mother

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.519
Mother! Mother!

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.839
Burn this witch!

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.240
Mother, burn her! Burn her!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.480
Hurry, burn her! Burn her!

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.519
Keeping her is a disaster.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.240
Burn this witch!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.040
Sister

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.800
Sister, eat.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.079
Two petty thieves.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.800
How dare you steal food in our village!

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.399
We just found it.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:23.319
We found it.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.439
I'll teach you to steal!

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.000
Don't hit us! We won't steal again!

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.480
Don't hit us! Will you steal again?

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.000
Will you steal again?

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.079
Don't hit us! Let you steal, huh?

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.600
Steal...

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.639
Don't hit us! I'll beat you to death!

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:35.800
Hit!

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.160
Don't hit us! I let you steal?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.360
Don't hit us!

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.160
Let you steal!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.560
Don't hit us!

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.399
Don't hit us!

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.000
Don't hit us!

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.920
Don't worry.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.120
It's safe here.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.199
No one will hurt you.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.519
I... I...

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.199
I picked some wild fruit for you.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.480
Do you want to try some?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.240
I really like them.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.319
Senior Brother

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:40.000
You said Feng Wuzhou was strong as an ox before.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.240
He was perfectly fine.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.519
Why did he suddenly faint?

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:47.120
There are still two silver needles in her skull.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.480
It's the silver needles causing trouble.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.560
What? There are still silver needles inside?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.439
Keep your voice down.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.240
Don't let her hear.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.560
There are still silver needles left.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.160
The people from Yunyin Mountain are useless.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.879
They actually let the Young Master get hurt.

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.079
If I were there,

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.279
I'd risk my life to keep the Young Master safe.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.920
Dongqing is at least a righteous man.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.120
He's been pretty good to me too.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.279
Is it genuine or just an act?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.360
It's hard to say.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.199
How is Yue'er?

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.879
I've been comforting Princess Yue.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.639
She should feel much better now.

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.680
The Young Master and Princess Yue

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.319
truly have a deep sibling bond.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.680
Young Master, did that hurt?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.439
It's nothing.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.439
I got a minor injury this time,

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:43.360
but the real corpse was hit by accident.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.680
We destroyed the undead.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.519
So it was an unexpected gain.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.879
Master, be gentle.

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.399
You little rascal.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.960
You even dared to touch your uncle master's prized possession.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.720
You deserved that beating.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.399
This time,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.960
he dislocated your arm.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.320
If it happens again,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.039
who knows what he'll break next.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:47.879
Master.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.039
I can move it now.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.720
It really doesn't hurt anymore.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:53.879
Master.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
I did all this for you.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:58.759
You little brat.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.159
Delicious roast rabbit.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.080
How is it?

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.080
It's average.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.759
Just average.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:26.360
Then don't eat it.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.039
I'll eat it.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.080
You brat, you're really eating it?

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.399
Put it down!

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:37.159
Didn't you say you wouldn't eat it?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.799
Stop right there!

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.320
You little brat, if it's average, don't eat it!

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.519
Master.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.200
It's all my fault, I'm useless.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.799
I still haven't found your whereabouts.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.759
It's me.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.440
Ow, ow, ow!

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.039
It hurts, it's killing me!

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.279
Useless, useless!

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.240
Useless!

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.240
Calm down, Young Master.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.919
What happened last night?

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:12.919
So many undead,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.320
and all of you living people,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.919
how did you let Second Young Master and Dongqing escape?

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.360
Please calm down, Young Master.

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:20.320
Everything was going smoothly.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.759
But we didn't expect

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.320
a group of vicious corpses to appear halfway through.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.960
Even Doctor Wang turned into a corpse.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.480
It caught us off guard, Young Master.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.320
What?

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.279
Even Doctor Wang turned into a corpse?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.399
Then...

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.159
I want this investigated thoroughly.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.639
Not only did they trick Awu away,

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.919
they even took Doctor Wang.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.080
Those are my people.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.720
Only I get to kill them.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.919
And another thing,

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.519
take my decree

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.759
and bring the death squad back from outside the city.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.879
Yes, yes.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.840
Since you're all so capable,

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:01.480
that you lost almost all my undead,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.759
let's see

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.039
if your luck is stronger

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.799
or my blade is sharper.
