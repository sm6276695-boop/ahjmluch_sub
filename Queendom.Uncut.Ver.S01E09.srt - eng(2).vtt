00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.880
Damn you, Fon!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.080
I really think you should
quit drinking on your own.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.240
Or maybe...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.040
just stop drinking altogether.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.600
I think you're way too drunk.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.960
Just go home.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.640
Fon.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680
Um...

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.360
About last night...

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.280
It's totally fine.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.400
No big deal.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.480
"No big deal"?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200
Well...

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.800
I know it was
because of the vibe and stuff.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.480
I know how things are.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.440
Thank you for letting me stay over.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080
No worries. I don't think much
about this kind of stuff.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120
So...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.160
don't think much of it.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.800
"No big deal"?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.400
Frank's room's gonna be here...

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.720
And...

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280
What are you doing?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.120
Why do you look so stressed out?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.200
It's the house plan.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm rushing this done,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.560
so Mom and Patty
can come live in Bangkok.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600
Lemme see.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.560
Good job!

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.880
If the house is done,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.640
could I live with you guys?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.360
But if we're still
in each other's bodies...

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.080
I would be the one

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.480
asking to move in.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.680
That's true.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, then...
how are we going to tell your mom?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.440
Hm...

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.800
Tell her...

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.640
you bring your girlfriend with you.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.880
You're crazy.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.240
We'd be taunted to death
if we did that.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.760
I'm hungry.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.520
Can you cook something for me, Print?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.760
I'm starving.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.680
I think...

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.800
I won't cook fast enough
for your hungry tummy.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.480
Why don't we go out to eat?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.640
And...what are we gonna eat?

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.320
Shabu-shabu?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840
No, my hair's gonna stink.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.120
How about pizza?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.280
Too many calories.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.280
Steak?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.560
Too heavy on the stomach!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600
Gosh!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.440
You're lucky I love you, you know?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800
What are you doing?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.680
You'll see!

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080
What is it?

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.080
Let fate decide!

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.360
Whatever you get, we'll eat that.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.160
No more being picky.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.480
Mm, okay.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480
Pick a number.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.600
Two!

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.600
How many moves?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.240
Eight!

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.920
One,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.840
two,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.840
three,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.600
four,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.520
five,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.520
six,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.720
seven...

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.920
eight!

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440
Noodles!

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.120
Okay!

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.720
The noodles are looking a bit sus today.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.120
Well, I wanna have sushi.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.400
Are you saying you don't want to?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.800
I want anything you want, Rey.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.160
Yay!

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.520
Big bite!

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.120
Smile!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.160
Nom!

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160
Try an "I Love Print" pose.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800
Let me see.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.480
Nope.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.480
Print! What are you doing?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.960
Posting a photo of my girl.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.960
It's a cute pic!

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400
Don't you like it?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.880
No, it's just...

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.240
What if we got caught?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.600
People are shipping us
as a girls' love couple.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.200
They won't find out we're actually...

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.080
girlfriends.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.560
Here.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.400
[Print is mad cute!]

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.440
[Of course, your girl is the prettiest!]

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.600
[The ghost in my room and I
are dying over the candid]

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.640
[Smiling so wide
I might need professional help]

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.520
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.440
One at a time, please.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.840
Oh, we're just friends!

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.120
Uh...

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.520
The leak you all saw

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.840
was from a group event,
not from a private trip.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.960
I'm focusing on my career right now.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.080
Follow me!

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.160
Watch your step.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
Gosh, the wave is mad!

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.160
Brace yourself.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.080
Being shipped is pretty good.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.480
No matter how open we are in public,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.440
no one's ever gonna catch us.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.480
No dating news either.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.920
But when you can't tell the world,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.400
it feels like we are a secret.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.560
Then...

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.520
should we tell everyone

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.040
that we are a real couple,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560
not just a ship?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.240
- Should we?
- If you dare.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.560
Guys! We are...

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.000
Print, I was kidding!

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.520
Oh...

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.160
Well, well...

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.640
you guys are always serving moments,
aren't you?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.000
Let's go inside.
Nitta is waiting.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.160
Right this way.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.960
I'm excited!

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.200
I really am!

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040
Hello.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.800
Whenever you're ready.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.440
I have been thinking about this, Dao.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.120
I'll tell everyone...

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.040
that we're together.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.480
Ploy...

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.120
If Mother finds out...

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.120
will she ever accept us?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.000
No matter what happens...

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.360
you're my person, Dao.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.240
I'll always protect you.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.760
Hm...

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.320
This is the chemistry
we're looking for.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
Thank you!

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.960
I'm happy!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.560
Have you been fine?

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.120
Mm.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920
I have.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840
What about you?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.840
I have.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.800
Mm...

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.960
That's nice.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.480
I don't see you
attached to Rey as often,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480
so I was just wondering...

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.920
if you've been avoiding me.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.080
Girl,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.680
I've never ever been attached to Rey.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.360
I just drop her off and go on my way.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.800
Plus, the girls seem to prefer
having alone time.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.120
I'm just giving them some space.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.400
How was it?

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.400
Looks like the four of us
will be together for a while!

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.720
Pleasure to be working with you again.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.600
So, should we go celebrate a little?

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.440
Oh...

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.080
you two go.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.520
I have something to do after.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.320
Gee, Fon!

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.720
What would be important than me?!

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.000
Can't it wait?!

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It can't!

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.640
I signed up for speed dating.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.840
- Huh?!
- What?!

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880
What's gotten into you?

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.440
- Why?
- You're basically married to your work.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.800
You didn't even agree
when your mom set you up.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.200
Well, things have fallen into place now!

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.880
So I thought
I might give myself a chance.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.640
Then, can you take Wanmai with you?

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.160
She's also crazy about work.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.920
I'm not interested in this stuff.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.640
See? She said she isn't interested.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.640
She's only invested in her career.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.120
Unlike me,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.600
who will be lucky both
in-game and in love.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.480
I'm off.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.440
Enjoy your meal.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.280
Alright, everyone,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.520
you'll each have five minutes
to talk to your date at your table.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.320
After that, you'll move on
to another table

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.840
to talk to your next date.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.760
So we can start now?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.000
I guess so.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.320
I'm Saifon.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.560
Do you come to this often?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.080
Not really. I'm busy with work.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.200
How the heck did you get here?!

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.680
Oops, sorry.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.440
Well, Print and Rey decided
to go on a date,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
and I didn't want to say no.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.640
Please give me a sec.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.800
And why are you here?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.320
I thought you didn't like this stuff?

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.200
You know, just to kill time.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.480
By speed dating?

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.640
Why?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.760
There's nothing serious about it.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.800
If it goes well,
it's just fun and games.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.880
No big deal, isn't it?

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.840
Everyone here's looking
for a serious relationship.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.760
If you think it's fun and games,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.560
make sure people
know that from the start,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.720
so they don't waste their time.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.080
Everyone, you ready?

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.240
Start dating now!

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.800
Hi, what's your name?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.560
I am Wanmai.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.800
It's nice to meet you.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.240
Nice to meet you, too.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.520
Hold on. Something's in your hair.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.520
Oops, sorry.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.640
Your collar is... There.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.760
- I've been busy lately.
- I think there are too many flies here.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.120
- Yes?
- Maybe someone didn't shower.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.600
Just casually.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.720
Nothing significant or anything.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.320
Can I add you on LINE?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.960
Definitely!

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.280
That's too far.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520
Hi.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.360
Switch your date!

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.200
That must be someone else.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.520
Since yesterday,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.440
but I'll go back today...

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600
Switch your date!

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.080
Are you gonna stare at me
till we run out of time?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.320
Well,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.440
we're supposed
to get to know someone new,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.760
but I don't want
to know you any further.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.480
I still have so many things
you don't know about.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080
You do?

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960
Fine, then.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.440
How about we skip the questions

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.880
and go straight to the guessing game?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.160
No cheating allowed.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600
I'm in.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.040
You can start.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.920
First date: a coffee shop or a bar?

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.760
A bar.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.560
Hey!

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.240
Who the heck goes to a bar
for a first date?

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.080
I do.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.360
Gosh...

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.880
My turn.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.640
First date: eating in or dining out?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.400
A workaholic like you

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.000
definitely dines out.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.600
I prefer cooking a homemade meal.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.640
There are only a few minutes left...

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.760
Let's go by the rules

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.000
and ask one genuine question.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.440
Go on.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.600
Are you in love with anyone right now?

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.680
I am.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.920
I just don't think
she's ready for a commitment.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920
Plus...

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.640
I don't wanna get my heart broken
by her again.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960
What about you?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.000
Have you ever thought
about being committed?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.800
Time's up
for searching for the right person.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.560
Don't hesitate if you've found the one.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.360
Exchange your contacts
and get to know each other more.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.800
May you find
just who you're looking for!

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.720
[Mommy Dearest]

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.880
Yes, Queen?

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.600
Well, well, look who's been so into work
she forgets her mom.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200
Whoa...

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.240
Are you gonna be upset this time?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.720
If you don't want me to be,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.360
come back home to me this Friday.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160
Hold on, Mom.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.400
Alright, I'm free on Friday.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.800
I'll be home soon then, Mommy Dearest!

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.560
Bye.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.280
Hi, is that Print?

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.240
Just calling to say I'll go back
to Chanthaburi for 4-5 days.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.400
Hm?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.120
Why all of a sudden?

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.360
Mom asked me to,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.440
so I thought I'd just go annoy her.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.720
You want to go annoy her,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.440
or are you avoiding someone?

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.800
I don't know what happened
between you and Mai,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.800
but if you still love her,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.640
just shoot it straight to her.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.640
Tell her how you feel
and get it over with.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.480
What are you playing hide and seek for?

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.680
What is it ever gonna do?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.600
I'm hanging up. I need to pack.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.280
Is Fon really into Wanmai?

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.280
Mm.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.560
I knew it!

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.680
Back at the beach,
Fon asked a weird question about Mai.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.320
Fon's always like Mai
since she worked for her,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.880
but she always acts nonchalant.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.120
I can tell she still feels for her!

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.640
When Fon worked for Mai?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.480
Mm.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960
Wait!

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.920
Mai actually told me

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.920
she kissed a junior from work
while they were drunk

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.440
and developed some feelings for them.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.640
Do you think that junior was...

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.880
Saifon?

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.880
So Mai also likes Fon?!

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.760
Should we ask Mai for clarity?

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.480
Mm!

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.880
Let's call her.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.400
Hello, Mai?

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.600
Hello, Rey...

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.280
Are you...drunk?

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360
Mai!

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.720
- Mm...
- Are you alright?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.040
I'm...okay!

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.440
One of you ran off home,

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.440
and the other one is completely wasted.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.320
What's up with you guys?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.560
- Mai.
- Yeah, sweetie?

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.960
I have something to ask you.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.080
When you told me

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.560
you kissed a junior from work

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.680
and ended up falling for them,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.160
was it...

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.960
Saifon?

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.600
Even...you guys...can tell?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.880
Then why couldn't she?!

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.480
What...do I have to do

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.640
for her to realize how I feel?

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.560
Fon asked me that day...

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.040
if...I...

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.960
want to be committed to anyone,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:54.840
but...

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.760
I...didn't even
get a chance to tell her

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.720
that I want to be committed to her!!

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.400
I want to be in a relationship with her!

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.400
Well, why didn't you?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.640
How would I...

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.040
You're right! I will!

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.320
Bet, bet...

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.000
I'm telling her

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.480
that I want to be with her!

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Aight!

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.360
I don't think you can do that now...

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.400
Let go of me.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.000
Hands off!

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.520
I'm going to find Fon.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.880
I'm asking her to be my girl.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.480
Fon!!

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960
Are you awake?

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.360
Are you still feeling dizzy?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.680
Eat the porridge.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120
We bought it for you.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.120
After that, take a hangover pill

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.960
and get ready for Chanthaburi.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320
Chanthaburi?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.680
Why?

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.960
Last night, you spilled it all to us

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.200
that you're in love with Fon.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.160
And I can always tell

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.440
Fon feels the same way.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.240
To make a long story short,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.240
you're into each other,

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.880
so we're taking you to win her back.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.440
I don't know

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.320
if I should go...

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.160
What?!

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.800
You deadass wanted to last night.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.760
Yeah!

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.840
What makes you think you shouldn't go?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.640
Um...

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.440
it's...

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.440
it's not that I'm not into Fon,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840
but...

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.120
I'm not even sure

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.000
if I'm ready for the commitment.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.680
Also,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.960
I'm too scared
I'd turn out to be a bad partner.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.520
Mai,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.320
you're a master of everything,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.160
but you're scared by this nonsense?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.200
Mm...

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.080
Have you even asked Fon

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.840
if she thinks you're good enough?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840
Mai,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.840
love is about two people.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.040
If you spend
your whole life being afraid,

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.720
you're throwing everything away
before you even start.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.280
Mai,

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.280
are you really gonna let her go?!

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.520
Enough!

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:47.720
Enough...

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.880
Alright...

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.480
Drive safe, Rey.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.960
Text me when you get there.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.480
Mm!

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.840
It's too bad

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.920
Father and Mother called
to schedule a meal so suddenly;

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.480
otherwise, you'd get to
visit your mom, too.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.960
Then...can you go visit her
in my place, Rey?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.320
Mm!

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.240
And I'll have a meal with your parents.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.240
That works.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.360
Are we leaving?

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.040
We need to be there
before it gets dark.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.240
Well, well!

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.960
Look who's in a hurry now!

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.960
I'm leaving.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.680
You're home?

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.880
- Hello, Father.
- Mm.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.480
My daughter's been all the rage lately.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.600
Now I'm the one
keeping up with you on social media.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760
With that being said,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
might as well
share this article with Grandpa.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.920
And where's Mother?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.560
In the kitchen, dear.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.400
She decided to be the cook today.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.440
Maybe there's a celebration for you.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.840
Print!

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.160
Hi, Mom.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.320
Print, why are you home
all of a sudden?

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.120
My, my...

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.080
I was asking you to come back together,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.680
but you were dragging your feet around.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.080
See? I missed the chance
to tag along.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.280
I just happened to bring Wanmai
to run some errands here,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.320
so I took the opportunity to visit.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.560
Alright, then.
Come inside for a glass of water.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.440
Come on, Sis.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.720
I have to leave
to take care of some personal matters.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.880
Print, you wait at home.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.720
Alright.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.600
I'm here for my flowers!

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.680
- Hello.
- Hi, there!

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.240
Oh, Print,

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.480
you're here to congratulate Fon?

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:40.800
Pardon?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.240
Fon! Your Fon!

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.440
She only comes home
once in a while,

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.240
with no partners at that.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.560
I was worried her mother
would never have a grandchild.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.000
Coming home this time,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.440
her good fortune is finally showing!

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.680
She's gonna have a husband soon!

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.560
Huh?

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.840
My Fon?

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.480
That's right!

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.440
Today, her mom set her up
with a big-shot official's son.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.640
They've reserved
a hotel's dining room just for this!

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.320
Mai, let's hurry and get it done.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.560
- Mm.
- Let's go.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:22.920
I'll be back.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.200
Sis, where are you going?

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.160
I'll be back!

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.320
Something's wrong with the car.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.920
It won't start!

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080
How are things going, Man?

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.720
It's going;
things are pretty quiet lately.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.360
- Mm.
- How about you?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.160
The work's pretty rough,
but it's still okay.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.680
Wait,

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.680
is that big bike following us?

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.720
Hey, what the hell?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.560
Hey, you got a problem, bro?!

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.240
You want some of this?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.400
Alright! So you wanna fight!

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.640
What the hell are you doing?!

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.280
Did you buy your driver's license?!

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.440
I'll give you a piece of me!

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.280
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.680
Let me give them a knock on the head.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.840
Do you call that riding?

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.320
Do you own the street or something?!

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.280
Mai!

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.040
What are you doing here?

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.640
You know how to ride a motorcycle?

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.320
I told you

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.400
there's a lot you don't know about me.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.560
And who told you to ride that fast?!

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.680
You thought
you were Tom Cruise or something?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.040
You're one to talk?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.280
Running away for a blind date?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.280
You thought you were Nicole Kidman?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.360
Girlie, who's this hottie?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.760
She's not just a snack;

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.840
that's a whole meal!

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.160
I heard you went on a blind date...

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.880
but who'd know

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.840
you were just hanging out.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.080
I did go on a blind date with him.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.960
So...

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.240
his family wants him to get married,

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.920
and my mom also wants the same.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.880
We grew up together,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.320
so when the adults set us up,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.800
we went together just for fun.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.720
Um...

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.040
You know everything about me now.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.960
What about you?

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.320
Is there anything
I still don't know about?

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.120
I don't think you came
all the way here for a joyride.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.600
You see...

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.200
Fon.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.360
I'm here to talk to you.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.400
I didn't have a chance

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080
to answer you that day.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.720
I...want...

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.880
to try being committed
in a relationship.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.280
So?

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.280
Should we make it official?

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.400
Whoa!

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.400
What's the occasion?

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.880
This is a full-course meal.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:38.760
I'm celebrating you maintaining
La Lune's brand ambassador position,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.440
even though there's someone else
sharing the spotlight.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.840
Go ahead and eat.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.640
I need to have
a word with you after that.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.240
Eat up, dear.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.600
These are all your favorites.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560
Thank you.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.400
I'm leaving the single lady club!

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.360
Fine, I'll give you this one.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400
- Hey!
- What?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.560
That was mine!

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.960
- Saifon and I are together now.
- I was eyeing that pork!

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.320
I think I'll spend the night at Fon's.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.040
Can you sleep
at Print's house on your own?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.720
It's now burnt!
[No sweat, Wanmai; see you tomorrow]

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.200
Finally, everyone lives
happily ever after.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.120
What were you on about, Sis?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.560
Oh, I was just...

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.640
happy that everyone's here together.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.200
Find more time to come home.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.200
I really miss you, dear.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.600
Take some breaks, okay?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.240
Gee, Mom!

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.240
She's now a rising star!

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.360
I'm sure her schedule is packed.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.480
I just want to work really hard

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.760
and earn money for our new house

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.240
so that we all can live there.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.160
That way, we can be together

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.520
and eat Thai barbeque
like this more often.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.840
Isn't it great?

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320
Uh...

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.320
I'll go bring more veggies for you guys.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.520
Wait, Mom! I'll help!

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.400
Do you think I should tell Print now?

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.120
Wow, Mother!

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.920
That is epic!

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.960
It's true that my dream
was being an actress,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.240
but now, my dream is within you,
do you realize?

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.080
Do you know

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.080
that taking care of you

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.680
and watching you grow
into a celebrated actress...

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.840
is a dream come true for me.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.200
Thank you very much, Mother,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.160
for everything you've done for me.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.760
Rey,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.080
a couple of days ago,
I got a call from a Chinese agency.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.480
They want you
to work with them over there.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.040
With one condition:

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.880
you need to cancel
all your work in Thailand.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.640
Sis,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.600
I'll take a quick bathroom break.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.160
Mm!

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.320
I don't want
to hide this from her anymore.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.000
She'll have to find out eventually.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.600
I understand that,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.680
but do you think she can handle it

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.520
if she knows you have a new partner?

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.360
She would blow up

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.360
if she knows someone's replacing Dad.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.440
Mm...

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.880
Not to mention the house in Bangkok.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.760
No one here ever said
they wanna live there.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.000
[Rey]

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.600
[Call]

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.320
The dress has arrived!

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.400
Ooh, thank you, Mai.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.240
Are you tired?

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.600
What are you doing?!

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.000
The girls are here!

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.600
Why?

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.080
They already know we're together.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.480
The La Lune event starts
at 7 P.M. sharp.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.120
So, get ready quickly.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160
I'll take you two there.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.240
Yes, Mai.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.680
Rey, Print,
could you please move closer?

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.080
That's right. Gorgeous.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.720
There, there!

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.360
There...

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.400
- Mai, what are you doing?!
- Hm?

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.840
Why? Are you gonna blow up at me?

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.600
Don't you normally

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.080
remain miles away from me during work?

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.880
I don't want to be any inches away now.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.040
Please give a round of applause
to Miss Rey and Miss Print,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.320
La Lune's first-ever pair
of brand ambassadors!

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.200
First of all, could you please tell us

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.760
how you feel
being a part of this collection again?

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.920
For me, it is such an honor

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.400
representing the never-ending tale
of La Lune with Rey.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.920
The same goes for me.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.760
It's such a special opportunity
sharing the position with Print.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.640
On the occasion of being
our first pair of brand ambassadors,

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.800
if you were to compare each other to
a piece of jewelry in this collection,

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.160
what would the resemblance be?

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.800
I think Print is
the diamond of the collection,

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.520
considering how beautiful,

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.440
remarkable,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.280
and glistening she is.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.840
I also believe
Rey is the diamond of this collection,

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.840
which people praise for its beauty

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.960
and strength.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.200
In reality, no one ever realizes

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.400
how much pressure it has gone through

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.760
to turn into a magnificent,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.680
priceless work of art.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.000
Whoa...

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.680
That is probably the deepest question
anyone here has ever heard.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.360
We're now onto
the highlight of the night.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.920
I believe you all remember

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.280
the unforgettable opening show
by Rey, The Dancing Queen.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.920
As of now, there are
two Dancing Queens gracing our sight.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.800
Please welcome The First Dance
by Miss Print and Miss Rey!

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.400
I'm into your answer earlier, Rey.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.680
The same goes for yours.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.920
It's funny

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:49.880
how we used to think
the other person had it better

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.080
while being completely oblivious
to what the other had to go through.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.880
A couple of days ago,
I got a call from a Chinese agency.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.600
You need to cancel
all your work in Thailand.

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.760
But do you think she can handle it

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.080
if she knows you have a new partner?

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:39.960
Rey!

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440
Print!

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.840
We...

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.680
switched back?!
