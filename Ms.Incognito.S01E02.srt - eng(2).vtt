Thinking of having ramyeon for dinner?

00:15:20.533 --> 00:15:22.533
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:27.633
I do love ramyeon too, you know?

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:29.667
Want to share some?

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:31.667
Great idea.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.667
By the way, when did you save all that?

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.933
Just little by little.

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:45.833
Yes. No train station, four hours by car.

00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:47.767
It's a very peaceful place.

00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:51.967
It's the kind of town where you even know
how many spoons the neighbor has.

00:15:51.967 --> 00:15:54.333
Is there really a need to go
all the way to Muchang?

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:58.867
You risked your life for money too.
Do you think others are any different?

00:15:58.867 --> 00:16:00.367
If the siblings

00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:03.400
find out you're the heir,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.367
they'll come after you just like 15 years ago.

It's a good place to hide from those chasing you.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.567
And if they send a hitman,

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:20.000

Coincidentally, my sister runs

is the most dangerous.

I was wondering when you'd come.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.233
There's one thing I'm curious about.

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:05.967
Why do these Muchang strawberries
taste so exceptionally good?

00:20:05.967 --> 00:20:08.633
Oh, well...

Ah, yes.

00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:17.367
For the strawberries to grow well,

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:20.367
the weather can't be too hot
or too cold all year round.

00:20:20.367 --> 00:20:23.133
The soil is rich, and there's plenty of water.

00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:25.900
Muchang is just the perfect place for that.

Excuse me, Chairman.

May I ask just one thing?

00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:51.733
Yes.

Your condition has worsened.

00:23:41.067 --> 00:23:47.233

Yes, Professor.

They'd been cleverly hiding it
on the chart, but it was morphine.

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:51.100
Since morphine is a controlled drug,

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.067
it's legally restricted
to terminal cancer patients.

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:56.433
They can't hide it anymore.

it's no more than three months.

00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:07.467
It means the pain is going to be unbearable.

his children from worrying.

Sorry for the late introduction.

00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:55.200
That lady over there, our Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:10.567
Hey.

00:38:10.567 --> 00:38:12.600
Isn't that the bodyguard from back then?

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.733
No more 'hey', 'you', or 'that person'.

00:38:15.733 --> 00:38:16.767
Then what?

00:38:16.767 --> 00:38:19.033
One month ago, Ms. Kim Yeong Ran over there

My father...

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.067
Unbelievable, huh?

00:38:39.733 --> 00:38:41.667
Wait, what's that on your finger?

00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:43.767
Isn't that Mom's ring?

00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:48.400
Why are you wearing that ring?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.333
Take it off.

00:38:51.367 --> 00:38:52.867
Take off the ring. Can't you hear me?

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:54.033
This is a funeral home.

00:38:54.033 --> 00:38:55.433
- Let go!
- Chairman is watching.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.467

Hey, take that ring off now! I said take it off!

00:38:58.433 --> 00:38:59.767
Do you know what kind of ring that is?

00:38:59.767 --> 00:39:01.867
Ga Seon Woo!

Attorney Lee.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.300
What did he just say earlier?

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.167
Marriage registration?

00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:33.167
With you?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.333
Didn't you hear?

00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.667
Attorney Lee said that.

00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:43.567
From now on, I'm not longer
'you,' 'that,' 'this,' or 'that'.

00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:51.000
Then, if you're not 'this' or 'that,'

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.167

00:39:55.867 --> 00:39:58.633
From now on, I'm your mother.

Excuse me, coming through.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.300
One moment, please. Sorry.

00:40:33.967 --> 00:40:38.333
Ugh, Chairman Ga is so tacky.

00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:41.100

going to sit still like this?

take everything from us.

They say couples grow alike.

00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:45.367
You scared me!

00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:47.400
No.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.500
You startled me, Madam.

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.200
Madam, you were surprised, right?

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.300
Ask whatever you want to ask.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.700
Friend.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.000
Did you really marry the chairman?

Yes.

00:43:08.567 --> 00:43:10.133
When did you two do that?

00:43:10.133 --> 00:43:12.067
When everyone was asleep.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.967
No way, at night?

00:43:14.967 --> 00:43:18.600
Usually after 11 p.m., once the bell rings.

00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:22.067
Then

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.233
did you kiss the chairman too?

00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:26.300
We're a married couple.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.167
Insane.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.600

with me this whole time?

You're a year younger than me, born in '98?

- That's...
- What?

00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:04.867
Madam, would you like to continue
using your bedroom as is?

00:44:06.033 --> 00:44:07.500
We have guest rooms too.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.533
Or should I prepare another room?

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.067
It's fine.

00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:20.800
Are you truly okay with that?

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.600
Yes.

Ugh, I don't know.

You know Pungsan Paper, right?

00:45:25.233 --> 00:45:29.600
It's a small company compared to Gaseong Group,
but a similar uproar happened there.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.367
She seduced the Chairman at a hotel health club

00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:35.333
and even registered their marriage
without the family knowing.

00:45:36.267 --> 00:45:39.267
If the marriage registration is complete,
legally there's no problem.

00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:41.100
So?

00:45:43.167 --> 00:45:45.500
There's nothing we can do?

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.167
At this point, we can pursue
a reserved portion lawsuit,

00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:51.233
but making this public to the masses...

00:45:51.233 --> 00:45:53.267
Hey!

00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:56.033
Whose money was that originally?

00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:57.467
It was originally my mother's.

00:45:57.467 --> 00:45:59.767
That means it was originally ours!

00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:01.133
I know, I get it.

00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:04.000
But even if we convert
that wealth to current values,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.400
Chairman Ga Sung Ho's assets

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.033
after Madam passed away are far greater.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.800

00:46:52.867 --> 00:46:57.200

Ah, sorry, Professor.

from taking a single
step out of this house, right?

Yeong Ran detained for a week.

and Hapkido with several dan ranks,

00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:19.433

Sorry.

Yes.

From now on, Madam, you are not Kim Yeong Ran,

You'll live under the name Bu Se Mi
for exactly three months.

Just a word of caution.

00:57:01.167 --> 00:57:05.467
When you go to Muchang,
don't get lonely and start seeing men.

00:57:05.467 --> 00:57:08.767
Most women's lives get messed up because of men.

00:57:13.733 --> 00:57:16.267
I have no romance in my life.

Why is a guy who's not even
a supporting character here?

Excuse me. You're Ms. Bu Se Mi, aren't you?

Wow.

01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:54.800
We should file a missing person report.

Our mother left home.

You must really miss her.
