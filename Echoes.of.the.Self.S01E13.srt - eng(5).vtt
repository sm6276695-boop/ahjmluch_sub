[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.090
But in the end,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.060
you still died because of me.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.700
I thought I could change everything.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.680
But I found out
I couldn't change anything at all.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.080
I never expected to have actually
returned to 3 years ago.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.080
By some twist of fate,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240
I became Princess Fu Wei of Daqing.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.270
I thought it was heaven's blessing,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.490
allowing me to save myself

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.330
and protect you too.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.820
So I pushed you away again and again.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.280
I never thought...

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.190
But did you ever ask what I wanted?

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.810
Fu Wei.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.360
You say

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.320
you caused my death in our past life,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.760
and now you want to protect me.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.280
So you push me away.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.530
But what if I say

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.880
I don't want your protection?

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.760
What if I just want to be with you?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.150
Yan.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.860
I've been

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.870
to countless battlefields,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.700
never thought

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.050
I'd be protected like this now.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.560
Even now, when I think about it...

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.690
I still get a little angry.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.710
I don't care if you're human or ghost,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.820
I've chosen you.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.190
What's your choice?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.670
You only get one chance.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.790
You'll regret it.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.740
I won't.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.770
Fu Wei,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.910
do you know?

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.960
Actually,

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.190
since meeting you,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.190
I've had several dreams.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.930
In those dreams,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.829
at the Imperial City gate,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.730
arrows poured down.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.240
I fell in the snow,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360
and someone ran toward me.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.620
She called my name over and over.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.690
So,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.710
it wasn't just a dream,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.170
was it?

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.710
It was how our story ended.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.420
I'm not afraid.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.860
I even look forward to that day coming.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.170
Because in my dreams,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.530
you ran to me without hesitation

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.600
and called me Yan.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.270
It's wonderful.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.060
So between us,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.490
it wasn't just a chance encounter,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.500
but a bond spanning lifetimes.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.940
I will find a way

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.270
to keep you alive.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080
Your Highness, where are you going?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.580
You've already achieved your goal.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.700
Where I'm going

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.200
is none of your business.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.930
Your Highness, please wait.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Your Highness.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.840
I am the Princess of Daqing.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.420
Your Highness is
the Crown Prince of Yunrui.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.380
Our marriage

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.610
concerns diplomatic relations
between our two nations.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.050
If Your Highness abandons me
on our wedding night,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.640
once word gets out,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.360
it will cause scandal

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.540
and harm both our nations.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.280
I urge Your Highness

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.810
to think carefully before acting.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.880
Don't you know how you came by

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.330
this princess title yourself?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.210
I don't understand
what Your Highness is talking about.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.610
You don't understand?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.130
I'll make you understand soon enough.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.720
Rest assured.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.250
I won't harm you, the substitute, for now.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.480
Once I find the real Princess Fu Wei,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.130
I'll settle accounts with you then.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.760
Why would the real princess send
a substitute for the marriage alliance?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.880
Behind this,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.200
is there a sinister conspiracy?

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.990
The marriage alliance with Daqing,

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.270
the posthouse bandits,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.930
the Mid-Autumn Festival
assassination attempt,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.460
and the loan sharking case.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.340
These matters seem unrelated,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.700
yet they're intricately connected.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.170
Liang Feng.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:48.970
Your Highness.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.670
Go find the real Princess of Daqing.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.310
Huh?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.050
Only by finding
the real Princess of Daqing

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.909
can we solve all these mysteries.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.590
Yes.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.580
This way,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.250
Fu Wei can truly be safe.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.710
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.530
By order of the Crown Prince,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.320
effective immediately,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.180
Crown Princess,
you're confined to your chambers.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.560
No one knows that I killed Fu Wei.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.670
How could Li Shu suspect my identity?

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.900
I cannot sit and wait for my doom.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.210
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.880
Miss.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.640
This Seven-Star Lamp
is an ancient divine object.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.650
Using it to extend your life

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.679
may give you a chance of survival.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.710
Are you ready?

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.130
Please.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.120
In a moment,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.080
you will lose your five senses.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.450
Your Highness.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.600
You must think this through carefully.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.200
The life extension
through the Seven-Star Lamp

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.660
means two people will share one life,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.480
and there's no turning back.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.400
This girl has her heart set on you.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.130
And you are in love with her too.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.590
If you want to save her,

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.890
you must bind your fates as one.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.480
As long as she can live,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.070
whatever the cost,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.240
I am willing to pay it.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.810
To save her,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.500
you're willing to sacrifice
your own lifespan.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.390
Does she know about this?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
She doesn't need

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.040
to know this.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.570
The laws of Yin and Yang.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.600
The balance of the five elements.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.920
Blood as the guide.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.680
Soul as the bond.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.910
Your Highness.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.000
From now on,

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.610
your fates will be bound together,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.820
sharing life and death.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.150
If your fate is too heavy to bear,

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.390
I will change your fate

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.720
for you.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.570
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.520
I want to see

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.280
what the Crown Prince actually knows.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.650
Die!

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.480
Guards!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.880
Who are you?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.640
You don't need to know who I am.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.590
Do you remember

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.250
this token?

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.760
Let me go!

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.050
[Order]

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.500
Why do you have this in your possession?

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.380
Speak!

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.870
You used the pretext of confiscating
property to dispatch your private army

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.200
into the Cui's Mansion,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.090
transferring money

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.600
and erasing all traces of the crime.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.920
This token

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.730
is stained with the blood
of 48 members of my Cui family!

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.360
The Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion?

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.520
Lord Cui?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.600
When did I ever harm your family?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.230
You don't need to explain to me.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.460
Go make your explanation before them
in the underworld...

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.100
Enough.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.090
Take him away

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.320
and interrogate him thoroughly.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.930
I can't kill you,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.400
but I won't be captured by you either.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.830
The Crown Prince
brings disaster to the country.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.870
Heaven will destroy Yunrui!

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.250
What happened at this mansion tonight

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.740
must not be leaked.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.160
Otherwise, you'll be killed without mercy.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.540
Yes, Your Highness.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.670
Yes, Your Highness.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.690
Could the loan sharking case

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.010
actually be connected to the Crown Prince?

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.670
What secrets does the Crown Prince
really have?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.750
Here.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.500
The medicine is bitter,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.700
so I brought you some preserved fruits.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.460
Your hand is injured...

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.020
It's nothing,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.960
just a minor scratch.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.180
By the way,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.070
what are...

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.380
your plans

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.770
for the next step?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.720
Everything

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.860
started because of the Princess.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.530
In my previous life,

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.920
the Princess of Daqing
was killed within Yunrui's borders.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.640
Daqing seized the opportunity to invade,

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.900
leading to years of war

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.690
and unbearable suffering for the people.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.860
Although in this life,

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.220
the Princess escaped from the posthouse,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.890
it seems that everything

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.340
hasn't really changed at all.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.770
So

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.220
the Princess of Daqing

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.510
cannot fall into anyone else's hands.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.560
It seems Your Highness

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.610
has already begun investigating.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.820
Your Highness.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.540
Lieutenant Liang sent a message

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.940
that the Princess of Daqing
has been found.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.760
Your Highness,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.220
there's a secret message.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.470
[Prince Yan has found
Princess of Daqing's whereabouts]

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.849
The Princess of Daqing has been found.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.790
[The Crown Prince and Prince Yan
have found the real princess]

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.280
The show

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.700
begins now.
