00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.333
What does 'pitiful' even mean?

00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:16.133
It means a woman should have a nurturing vibe,

00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.167
but she's got no one to nurture.

00:36:18.167 --> 00:36:21.467
Is Father following the diet plan I made?

00:36:21.467 --> 00:36:23.933
Don't worry, Professor.

00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:28.933
I did major in food nutrition.

00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:31.533
Well, this time,

00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:34.700
I saw the chairman's latest health check,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.533
and his cholesterol is really high.

00:36:37.533 --> 00:36:42.167
When cholesterol is high,
the arteries can get clogged easily.

00:36:42.167 --> 00:36:44.133
If that happens,

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:48.400
the risk of stroke goes up.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.800
And with cholesterol,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.367
diet control is crucial...

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:57.533
Ugh, this brat.

00:37:10.167 --> 00:37:11.800
Oh, but,

00:37:12.833 --> 00:37:17.200
why only hire female guards, old man?

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.933
Father.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.233
How have you been feeling lately?

00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:13.833
Your cholesterol levels were high
again in the last health check-up.

00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:18.167
I made sure to strictly warn
Butler Choi to pay attention to your diet.

00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:21.667
Thanks to you, I think
I've been getting much better.

00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:31.400
[Late Lee Min Jeong]

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.833
Father.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.767
Even if you were only married for a year,
you should at least know Mom's favorite flower.

00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:12.200
It's peonies.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.300
[Late Lee Min Jeong]
A pricey and showy flower.

00:39:25.167 --> 00:39:29.133
Mom grew up without ever lacking
for anything, right?

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.300
As the daughter of a wealthy family.

00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:45.100
You know those two aren't
his biological children, right?

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.667
I didn't know.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:54.133
Chairman married a widow with two children.

00:39:54.133 --> 00:39:57.633
She died in a car accident after just a year.

00:39:58.367 --> 00:40:02.333
Not a drop of shared blood,
but legally they're family.

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.967
Ridiculous, isn't it?

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:09.800
What about the deceased daughter?

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.733
Oh? You're not completely clueless.

00:40:13.467 --> 00:40:15.667
She's the only biological daughter.

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:18.533
Some kid he fathered outside and brought home.

00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:21.333
Anyway, he brought her here once she was
fully grown and even sent her abroad to study.

00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:24.633
Then, she got into drugs and men, ugh.

00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:29.267
You can ignore that useless son.

00:40:29.267 --> 00:40:32.700
But watch out for the elder daughter.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.367
She's some professor at Se An University.

00:40:35.367 --> 00:40:37.733
She monitors every woman approaching the chairman.

00:40:37.733 --> 00:40:41.567
Butler Choi reports his every single move.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.667
Well, there's probably
nothing to report about you.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.167
What woman?

00:40:49.267 --> 00:40:51.567
Imagine a woman getting close to an old man

00:40:51.567 --> 00:40:53.667
who could die any day.

00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:56.100
They'd just cause headaches over the inheritance.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.633
This is my third time being a chaebol
family driver. I know how it works.

00:40:59.633 --> 00:41:03.300
Everyone smiles in front of everyone

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.200
but secretly waits for the day they die.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.267
All because of that darn inheritance.

00:41:09.933 --> 00:41:11.733
Why just wait for death?

00:41:11.733 --> 00:41:13.033
Huh?

00:41:13.033 --> 00:41:16.233
They could even kill him. In a world
where money makes anything possible.

00:41:17.467 --> 00:41:19.400
Our Lord's daughter,

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.033
on this 28th anniversary of
saint Lee Min Jeong's passing,

00:41:23.033 --> 00:41:25.800
let us all offer our prayers.

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:29.533
She strived to live by the Lord's word,

00:41:29.533 --> 00:41:35.567
our precious child of God Lee Min Jeong
who lived with love and faith,

00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:39.933
has been by the Lord's side for 28 years now.

00:41:39.933 --> 00:41:42.333
- This gathering...
- Sister.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.567
Mom was Buddhist.

00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:49.533
The warm memories and love left by the departed

00:41:49.533 --> 00:41:53.467
still live among us,
so let us reflect on this truth.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.600
Go buy some coffee. Something iced.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.400
Pardon? Coffee...

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.167
Yes, yes.

00:42:18.733 --> 00:42:20.333
Right away...

00:42:31.833 --> 00:42:34.667
The wound on your wrist.

00:42:35.933 --> 00:42:38.400
How did that happen?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.200
If I answer you,

00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:43.900
can I ask a question too?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.067
Answer first.

00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:49.367
I was hit.

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:51.300
By whom?

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.500
It's my turn to ask.

00:42:57.633 --> 00:42:59.933
Chairman, you set up hidden cameras, didn't you?

00:43:04.467 --> 00:43:07.100
At first, I thought you were a perv.

00:43:11.933 --> 00:43:14.900
But there's none in bathrooms or dressing rooms.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.500
Two buildings but only one kitchen?
That's weird too.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.600
Is someone trying to kill you, Chairman?

00:43:28.067 --> 00:43:30.533
I didn't ask you to question me.

00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:32.233
Keep searching.

00:43:33.333 --> 00:43:35.167
Any reward if I find something?

00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:38.400
Ever gone on a treasure hunt,
like on a school trip?

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.733
Never been on a school trip.

00:43:40.733 --> 00:43:43.767
Think of this as a picnic at my house

00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:45.900
and take your time.

00:43:57.433 --> 00:43:59.033
Oh.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.967
The chairman won't be having lunch today.

00:44:01.967 --> 00:44:05.533
Ugh, I prepared special dishes.

00:44:05.533 --> 00:44:07.467
Forget it.

00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:09.200
Ah, by the way, Butler?

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.600
Yes, why?

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.433
Why are you cooking when you're
supposed to be doing butler duties?

00:44:15.067 --> 00:44:17.200
I enjoy cooking.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.367
Liking something and being good at it
are two different things.

00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:22.500
If I did what I liked, I'd be in Hollywood now.

00:44:23.467 --> 00:44:26.433
Your face isn't cut out for it!

00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:27.433
Ugh, seriously.

00:44:27.433 --> 00:44:28.800
Hey, Ms. Yeong Ran?

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.900
You should eat this, Ms. Yeong Ran.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.700
Oh, my stomach's upset today.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.367
Need the restroom.

00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:41.800
Hye Ji, seriously...

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.833
How can they not appreciate this fine dish?

00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:47.467
You try some.

00:44:49.067 --> 00:44:51.833
- Looks delicious.
- Right?

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:55.267
Enjoy your meal.

00:44:55.267 --> 00:44:57.533
Huh?

00:44:57.533 --> 00:44:59.233
What?

00:45:01.433 --> 00:45:03.500
Did they notice something?

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.367
Ugh, what good does it do if I cook?

00:45:07.367 --> 00:45:10.733
Today's lunch is chicken. Chairman.

00:45:10.733 --> 00:45:14.867
Even so, you should eat Butler Choi's
food occasionally. Right?

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.600
The thing I hate most in this world
is tasteless food.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.067
How can I trust food made by someone
Seon Yeong planted here for me?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.167
[You're rich enough, why not hire a chef?]

00:45:47.567 --> 00:45:49.800
You've been smiling a lot lately.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.967
I was planning to stay home during this holiday.

00:45:56.967 --> 00:46:01.033
If you're free, come over
for braised ribs and soju.

00:46:02.133 --> 00:46:05.267
Or we can have chicken and beer
like people do these days.

00:46:05.267 --> 00:46:09.200
Chairman. I too have a place I call my hometown.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.833
It's a four-hour drive from Seoul.

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:12.200
No train station either.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.533
A place where everyone knows
what the whole village had for dinner tonight.

00:46:15.533 --> 00:46:18.600
And what they'll eat tomorrow morning.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.700
That kind of horrible hometown.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.767
Where's your hometown?

00:46:22.767 --> 00:46:24.067
Muchang.

00:46:24.067 --> 00:46:27.300
The strawberries you eat are delivered
every other week from there.

00:46:28.267 --> 00:46:31.400
Then, bring some strawberries on your way back.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.133
Okay.

00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:42.667
Thank you.

00:46:48.367 --> 00:46:50.100
Alright.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.700
This time, particularly,

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:56.167
your bonus is 20% higher than last time.

00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:58.567
Meeting adjourned.

00:46:58.567 --> 00:46:59.900
- Thank you, Attorney Lee.
- Thank you.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.733
- Thank you.
- Want to share a ride?

00:47:03.433 --> 00:47:07.567
Friend, when I post my photoshoot,
hit 'like' right away, okay?

00:47:07.567 --> 00:47:08.667
Okay.

00:47:08.667 --> 00:47:10.633
When are you going home?

00:47:11.744 --> 00:47:14.333
Later this evening.

00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:17.967
Both my parents work late, so I go home late.

00:47:19.233 --> 00:47:21.800
Wow, you must be bored.

00:47:59.467 --> 00:48:01.667
You waited long enough.

00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:05.400
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if you hid like that?

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.033
How did you know?

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.633
How many CCTV cameras do you think this house has?

00:48:15.033 --> 00:48:17.200
Two in the annex entrance and hallway.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.767
One in the main building entrance.

00:48:18.767 --> 00:48:22.000
Three in the living room and first-floor hallway.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.633
One next to each window.

00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:28.400
Oh, and there's one at the back door too.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.433
You found quite a lot.

00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:35.700
Do you know the best way to cook this ramyeon?

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.267
No, I don't.

00:48:40.867 --> 00:48:44.100
Just follow the instructions
on the back of this packet.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.333
Don't add or reduce anything,
cook it exactly as instructed.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:49.700
That's how it tastes best.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.267
It's really delicious, Dad.

00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:37.600
Slow down.

00:49:39.467 --> 00:49:41.167
Thank you.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.133
It's so good.

00:49:56.367 --> 00:49:58.833
Are you thinking of your late daughter?

00:50:07.533 --> 00:50:09.500
You knew already?

00:50:11.867 --> 00:50:13.467
Yes.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.567
Back when I had nothing,

00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:22.000
I briefly dated a woman.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.200
After we broke up,

00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:27.067
she gave birth to a child.

00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:31.367
So that child grew up in an orphanage

00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.400
for 19 years

00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:38.167
without even knowing I existed.

00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:43.633
Angry at the world for abandoning her,

00:50:48.167 --> 00:50:51.000
full of resentment toward me,

00:50:51.867 --> 00:50:54.467
she was all bristled up.

00:50:56.633 --> 00:50:59.200
Like a hedgehog.

00:51:04.933 --> 00:51:07.367
Do you know why

00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:10.100
a hedgehog raises its quills?

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.367
To protect itself.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.500
Because it has no other way.

00:51:33.967 --> 00:51:35.100
Are you okay?

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:38.033
Sir, pull yourself together!

00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:39.767
Where? Where?

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.433
Butler Choi.

00:51:45.433 --> 00:51:47.467
Chairman Ga isn't alone, you say?

00:51:47.467 --> 00:51:49.833
Ah, I couldn't confirm it exactly.

00:51:49.833 --> 00:51:54.267
The new bodyguard mentioned leaving late.

00:51:54.267 --> 00:51:57.100
You should've informed me about this earlier.

00:51:57.733 --> 00:52:00.067
Who knows what they might do together?

00:52:12.633 --> 00:52:14.267
Professor.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.400
There's something I'm curious about you.

00:52:31.967 --> 00:52:35.767
Go ahead, I'll pay for the ramyeon.

00:52:35.767 --> 00:52:39.867
How did you serve six months for stealing
something worth only ten thousand won?

00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.800
What do your parents do?

00:52:54.833 --> 00:52:57.633
Huh? Chairman, I'll go check.

00:52:58.667 --> 00:53:02.467
You stay hidden since no one can see you here.

00:53:02.467 --> 00:53:04.667
I have an idea who it might be.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.500
Who is it?

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.633
Father, it's me.

00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:43.967
Father.

00:53:43.967 --> 00:53:46.333
Ramyeon during the holiday? Seriously?

00:53:46.967 --> 00:53:48.967
It's raining, why are you here?

00:53:48.967 --> 00:53:50.900
Is something wrong?

00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:25.667
Open up.

00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:27.767
Not opening?

00:54:27.767 --> 00:54:29.900
Hey, Yeong Ran, are you there?

00:54:31.233 --> 00:54:32.900
Darn.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:35.133
Hey, Yeong Ran! Kim Yeong Ran!

00:54:37.733 --> 00:54:39.400
Ugh!

00:55:22.967 --> 00:55:24.667
Seon Yeong.

00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:38.967
Yeong Ran.

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.700
Kim Yeong Ran.

00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:52.167
Yeong Ran.

00:55:53.167 --> 00:55:55.233
Where are you?

00:56:11.567 --> 00:56:14.467
Yeong Ran.

00:56:14.467 --> 00:56:16.833
Where are you?

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.367
Are you in there?

00:57:04.333 --> 00:57:06.967
All checked, yes? You can go now.

00:57:14.367 --> 00:57:17.200
Take good care of yourself and eat well, Father.

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.133
I bought this myself at the department store.

00:57:20.133 --> 00:57:22.200
Yeah, I'll enjoy it.

00:57:34.067 --> 00:57:35.968
She's gone.

00:57:35.968 --> 00:57:38.167
You can come out now.

00:58:25.867 --> 00:58:28.200
I enjoyed the ramyeon.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.767
[Chairman Ga Sung Ho]

00:59:31.333 --> 00:59:32.933
Yes, Chairman.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.400
Come in.

01:00:57.133 --> 01:01:00.233
I mostly eat and sleep here.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.233
Chairman.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.467
Is someone really trying to kill you, Chairman?

01:01:58.367 --> 01:02:00.533
My daughter, Ye Rim.

01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:14.167
I saw the article.

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:17.400
Drugs, men, and all that...

01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:23.633
That's not true.

01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:28.233
My daughter was murdered.

01:02:31.967 --> 01:02:37.333
She was 19 when she first came to this house
and said she wanted to study art.

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:39.667
I sent her to New York.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:44.300
All by herself.

01:02:55.133 --> 01:02:57.300
The monster who killed my daughter.

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:06.733
It was late, but I sent someone to New York.

01:03:06.733 --> 01:03:10.867
In the article from a local newspaper,
there was a photo.

01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:15.333
I found the original photo and enlarged it.

01:03:17.533 --> 01:03:19.933
Seon Yeong was there.

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.200
How's studying abroad? Managing okay?

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.800
Yeah.

01:03:30.567 --> 01:03:34.800
I missed you so much that I had to come visit.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.467
Ah.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:49.033
How could family do something like that?

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:53.067
That scar on your wrist. Did your family do that?

01:03:54.567 --> 01:03:56.767
Because of the money.

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:59.067
To those punks, I'm just

01:03:59.733 --> 01:04:03.667
the one who snatched the inheritance
they were supposed

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:07.200
to get from their mother.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.967
But then Ye Rim appeared,

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:15.333
who might inherit the company's management rights.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:17.833
She must have become an eyesore.

01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:21.467
Yeong Ran,

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.467
I'm terminally ill.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.200
At most, six more months.

01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:34.733
Before I die,

01:04:34.733 --> 01:04:37.567
I want to take revenge on those punks.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.833
And in the way they fear the most.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.867
There was a rumor circulating among bodyguards.

01:05:43.133 --> 01:05:46.067
Sometimes, when protecting wealthy people,

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.767
they get offers for contract killings

01:05:48.767 --> 01:05:51.167
along with large sums of money.

01:05:57.867 --> 01:05:59.500
Chairman.

01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:03.533
What can I do for you?

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.233
Yeong Ran,

01:06:49.367 --> 01:06:51.633
marry me.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.767
♫ Now is the time ♫

01:07:23.767 --> 01:07:31.833
♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:35.000
♫ I share the light ♫

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.767
♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.767
♫ It's not over ♫

01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:51.300
♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.600
It's different from what was said earlier, right?

01:07:55.133 --> 01:07:58.133
They'd been cleverly hiding it
on the chart, but it was morphine.

01:07:58.133 --> 01:08:00.900
I'll deposit the fee into your account.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.367
- Let go!
- The chairman is watching.

01:08:02.367 --> 01:08:03.600
Ga Seon Woo!

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.300
I might get 100 million won, you know?

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.700
You'll be the bait, setting the trap and waiting.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.367
Now, from this moment,

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.567
you're not Kim Yeong Ran,
but Bu Se Mi the teacher.
