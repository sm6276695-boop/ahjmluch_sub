00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.140
(Episode 78)

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.540
What are you doing here?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.710
This room will be mine soon enough.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.810
- I figured I'd get used to it.
- Who says this will be your room?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.750
Get out. Now.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.520
I said, get out!

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.290
I think you're the one who should leave,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.320
not me.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.700
(Mingang Distribution)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.340
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.310
There's no need to look at me like that.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.280
This is what the chairman wants.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.580
It doesn't matter if it's the chairman.
You can't just ignore the procedure.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.420
You think the shareholders' meeting
and the board are a joke?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.320
My father is just pushing this through
on a whim.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.660
He's going to be called a lone wolf
for his outdated management style.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.670
Because of you, everything I've worked for
is about to collapse.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.840
You must think all you have to do
is get rid of me.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.840
But I'm not the biggest hurdle
you have to overcome.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.940
It's the Mingang organization
and its employees,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.850
the procedures and protocols,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.080
common sense, and the law.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.790
It takes more than just charming
an old chairman.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.560
So stop getting ahead of yourself
and acting like you're the CEO.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.530
Now, put that...

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.530
back where you found it.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.970
I knew it.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
Min Kyung Chae
won't back down that easily.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.310
Chairman Min might handle
the shareholders,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.810
but the board is the problem.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.510
Most of the directors are loyal
to Min Kyung Chae.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.510
This time, even Min Soo Jung
will side with her sister.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.720
Even sworn enemies band together
when it counts.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.620
And Min Kyung Chae has dirt on them all,
so it won't be easy.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720
What do we do now?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.260
With people like that,
you just find other dirt on them.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.560
I'll have Tae Joo look into it.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.100
We need specifics if we're going to
blackmail or persuade them.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
What did you say?

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.370
That woman was in the CEO's office?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.110
She may have pretended otherwise,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.610
but she's wanted to get her hands on
Mingang Distribution all along.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.020
With the chairman's stake and his backing,
she seems to think she runs the world.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.390
Still, as long as the board supports you,
there's no way she can win.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.190
Siding with her would be career suicide.
They'd have to be crazy.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.090
Besides, if we really wanted to fight it,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
the chairman's unilateral dismissal of you
could easily be challenged.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.300
I'm letting it go because of what I did
to my father,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.400
but if he crosses the line,
I'll have to reconsider.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.240
If it comes down to it, we can take
legal steps against the chairman.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.810
What do you mean by that?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.480
Your attempt to send the chairman
to a nursing home was a moral issue.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.880
But right now,
the chairman is ignoring corporate law...

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.450
to make someone
who is completely unqualified...

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.620
Mingang Distribution's CEO.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.090
Being morally questionable...

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.990
is a whole different thing
from breaking the law.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.730
Excessive loyalty is a flaw.
You should have stopped her.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.140
You knew Kyung Chae was in the wrong,
and you just played right along?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.170
I know I deeply disappointed you
regarding the nursing home.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.470
But that's not the whole story.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.710
- About how I feel about you, Chairman...
- Enough.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.520
I found out exactly how you feel
about me that day.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.550
Don't you dare try anything at the meeting
about who's on the CEO's side!

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.590
I'm calling a board meeting
to replace the CEO with Lucia.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.690
You can't.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.030
It's true that I, as your subordinate,
and Kyung Chae, as your daughter,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.000
have hurt you terribly. But...

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.470
that has nothing to do with this.
I cannot allow you to make her CEO.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.710
Who are you to allow or disallow anything?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.340
Appointing someone with neither the skill
nor the qualifications to be CEO...

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.010
Not qualified?
You know her qualifications best.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.920
And she already proved her ability
with the Helena Louise contract.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.950
If she were really that qualified,

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.450
you wouldn't have called me here.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.490
The fact that you're trying to ignore
procedure and protocol...

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.290
to put that woman in the CEO's chair
means it's weighing...

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.630
- on your conscience, doesn't it?
- What was that?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.360
Put your personal feelings aside.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.030
An appointment made without consensus
will ultimately become a liability.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.100
Forcing an appointment like this
will only tarnish your reputation.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.880
He's making her CEO without a clue
as to who she really is.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.490
The day I finally manage
to make Min Kyung Chae the chairman,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.890
I will expose exactly who this Lucia
you trust so much really is.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.970
Hey, listen.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.400
Because you're the boss, does that mean
you can treat your team however you want?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.470
However I want?
Who have I been treating...

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.570
I get it.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.140
Min Kyung Chae?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.650
Working her late, sending her for coffee.
That old-school stuff doesn't fly anymore.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.020
The "old-school" way of doing things
you're talking about...

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.850
is what builds a team and forms
the foundation of a partnership.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.120
Just because it's the old way
doesn't mean it's outdated.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.960
Always the know-it-all, aren't you?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.430
- Anyway, just don't treat her like that.
- Do I have to correct you?

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.700
She's not the CEO. She's a staff member.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.370
And I'll handle my team my own way.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.210
How long do you think she'll be there?
She'll be back in her old position soon.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.610
We'll have to wait and see, won't we?

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.250
You never know what the future holds.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.790
I'm sure she wants her position back.
But then again, who knows?

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.120
She might just end up staying
on my team for good.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.130
That jerk...

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.040
Darn it.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.810
An appointment made without consensus
will ultimately become a liability.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.280
Forcing an appointment like this
will only tarnish your reputation.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.360
Is there something on your mind?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.330
No. It's nothing.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.440
Are you happy now you pushed my sister out
to take the CEO position?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.580
But if things go south because of this,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.220
the chairman could end up cornered
and at odds with the board.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.790
What are you talking about?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.420
He can't appoint a new CEO
without the Board of Directors' approval.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.090
But knowing how stubborn he is,
he's not going to give up, either.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.600
So you're saying I've put the chairman
in a difficult position?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.500
You didn't know?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.970
I told you not to worry.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.000
Who do they think they are
to take me down?

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.940
When I heard you were demoted,
I thought I was going to faint.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.080
I have a plan.
This is just a temporary step back.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.510
I'll get everything back soon,
and I'll kick that woman out of our house.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.150
You need to hurry.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.990
Se Ri is getting closer to that woman.
It's making me sick with worry.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.560
We just have to believe that
blood is thicker than water.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.630
Someday, I'll tell her the truth,
and she'll finally call me her mother.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.030
You must never forget.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.030
How you gave birth and saved that baby
from the brink of death.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.040
How could I ever forget?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.990
When did you get back from the States?

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.860
Wait, what's going on?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.800
And when did you have a baby?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.570
You couldn't have gotten married
all of a sudden.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.870
Manager Gong, I think something's wrong.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.270
What is it? Are you having contractions?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.810
I don't know.
I've been feeling strange for a bit.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.680
We need to get you to a hospital, now.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.080
No.
He and Soo Jung will find out if we go.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.020
Let's go to the holiday home
in Yangpyeong.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.450
Giving birth there is too risky.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.490
What if there's a problem?
It's your first.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.390
Let's just go!

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.090
I can't have the baby here, can I?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.500
Just hang in there.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.340
Please, hurry!
Something awful is going to happen to her!

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.210
Try to relax.
It's still too early for the baby to come.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.750
If you use up all your strength now,
you'll be exhausted later.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.830
Just a little longer. A little more.
Okay, now, control your breathing.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.330
You can't give up now. Can you hear me?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.970
Come on, you can do it.
Okay, just one more time.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.970
One more time!

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.310
Okay.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880
Okay, you're almost there! One last push.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.190
Oh my goodness,
she's the spitting image of her mother.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.260
Look.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.530
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.640
Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.040
Ms. Kyung Chae!

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.110
Ms. Kyung Chae, wake up!

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.510
Ms. Kyung Chae!

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.920
Why did she suddenly stop crying?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.420
Sweetie!

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.990
I was so worried back then
that I was going to lose you and the baby.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.830
That was already twenty years ago.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.440
Luck was on our side.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.710
I would've lost my mind
if I'd lost you both.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.880
We went through so much to have her.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.550
Right now,
she's just under that woman's spell.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.390
Once she finds out the truth,
Se Ri will come around.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920
You think so?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.360
Of course.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.590
That's why we have to protect them.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.900
Both Se Ri and the company.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.870
What are you two doing here?

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.620
For the first live commerce broadcast,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.690
let's feature online and offline products
at the same time.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.760
We'll offer a mix of online products
and items from Home and Mart.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.400
And we'll broadcast it simultaneously
on other channels.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.530
That's the only way
both teams can benefit.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.870
Why come to someone like me with this?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.000
I'm just a junior staff member.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.140
You're in charge of it, aren't you?

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.910
Director Moon told me
to discuss it with you.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.940
Since when does a director
consult with a regular employee?

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.680
Why are you being so cynical?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.650
It's nothing if the board doesn't approve.
It's not that serious.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.920
You'd love it if I got on Dad's bad side
for good, wouldn't you?

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.760
Then convince Dad yourself.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.300
Make the case for why you should be
the CEO, not Lucia.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.130
What's your point?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.600
Just prove how capable you are.
So capable that no one can argue.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.640
Make up for getting on Dad's bad side
by proving your worth.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.070
You want me to compete with her?

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.410
It's the surest and fastest way, isn't it?

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.050
You should just go head-to-head
with her at work.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.320
And completely crush her.
It's that simple.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.320
Do you think Dad would still be
this stubborn if you did that?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.930
You should just go head-to-head
with her at work.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.440
And completely crush her.
It's that simple.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.670
Do you think Dad would still be
this stubborn if you did that?

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.630
I want to do the new live commerce show's
first broadcast with my stepmother.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.570
- Stepmother?
- She's your wife, so she's my stepmother.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.140
What's gotten into you?

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.470
But why insist on working with her?

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.170
She wants to come back
to the company, right?

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.410
Isn't that what you and she both want?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.650
Then tell her to come to the office.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.080
And make her the CEO,
just like you wanted.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.720
What's with this sudden change of heart?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.990
But it's only a temporary position.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.620
We can't leave the position vacant
until the board gives its formal approval.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.390
Temporary means she could be forced
to step down at any time.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.830
Why don't we see who performs better
during the first broadcast...

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.800
and let that decide things?

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.740
In our industry, what's more definitive
than sales performance?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.310
Are you saying you want to compete
with her for the CEO position?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.180
I don't see why not.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.220
I told him to make her the CEO.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.120
Her? You can't be serious.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.430
But why would you do that?
There's no telling what she might do.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.300
It's only temporary.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.440
I thought it was the only way Father
would forgive us, by giving in to him.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.200
Do you think Lucia will understand
your real intentions?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.140
She'll just think she got the job
on her own merit.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.210
That's why I added a condition.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.280
I told him I'd compete against Lucia
during the upcoming live commerce launch.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.620
Whoever proves to be more competent...

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.780
will get the board's approval.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.650
So you've set up a direct competition
for the CEO position?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.920
This might actually be a good thing.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.630
The chairman won't be able
to be so stubborn anymore.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.790
Take this opportunity...

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.770
to show her what you're made of
and win the CEO title fair and square.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.770
I have an announcement
before we prepare for the first broadcast.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.080
As requested by Director Min Soo Jung,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.610
we'll be selling products from both
the online and offline teams at once.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.880
That's not a bad idea.
It could be a win-win.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.120
Running two live channels at once
will create a lot of work for our team.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.930
Don't worry about that.
If you handle one channel, Kyung Chae,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.230
- we'll take care of the rest.
- No.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.670
The other channel has its own host.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.100
Our team just needs to provide support.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.440
I'm bringing in
a professional host for it.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.370
Another host? Who would that be?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.110
An outsider?

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.380
Did you already hire someone?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.810
I've already reported it to the chairman
and he approved,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.350
so focus on preparations.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.420
Who is it?

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.130
It may be a temporary position,
but if you, as the CEO,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.730
show them what you can do,
no one will dare to object.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.300
When Kyung Chae made that offer,
she must have had a plan.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.680
Is that what's been troubling you
for the past few days?

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.980
It's not something I can
just force on people.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.350
It'd be one thing if the board
approved the new CEO on their own,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.650
but if I force it on them,
it's bound to cause problems later.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.220
I must have put you
in an awkward position.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.830
I don't want to be CEO
if it means forcing the issue like this.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.630
What are you talking about?
Then why did I transfer my shares to you?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.700
Just the thought is enough for me.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.500
I'd hate for people to think
that out of greed,

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.600
I pushed you to do this.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.970
I know you have no selfish intentions.
If I know that, what does it matter?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.780
Like it or not, just go along with
what that brat Kyung Chae suggests.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.210
All you have to do is prove yourself
with your abilities.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.320
If that's what you want, Chairman.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.250
After all, your wishes are
what's most important to me.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.430
This is the best you could come up with?
A competition for the CEO position?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.430
Is there any reason we can't?

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.770
What company makes people compete
for the CEO position?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.540
It's not like Mingang Distribution
is some mom-and-pop store.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.970
That's exactly why we should do it.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.440
What do you think people will think?

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.650
A mother and daughter fighting over a job?
Does that look good to you?

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.880
So if you don't want us fighting
over this position,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.920
you should just be a good mother
and hand it over to the daughter?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.160
Hello? Se Ri, what's up?
Do you need something?

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.890
I can't sleep because
it feels empty without you?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.400
I was just about to head up anyway.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.430
Okay, I'm coming. I'll tuck you in.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.110
Just you wait.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.470
The CEO title and Se Ri...

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.480
I'm not going to let you
take them from me.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.580
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.000
I see you've made your decision.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.030
Why else would I be here?

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.870
The board hasn't officially voted
on my dismissal yet.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.240
- So for now, the CEO title
- will be handled as a transfer.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.510
So in the end,

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.910
the Board of Directors is in your pocket?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.550
Didn't you know?
I'm doing this for Father's sake.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.220
He's crazy about his young wife,

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.760
so I get why he'd want to see you
be CEO at least once.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.690
For comforting the old man
who was disappointed in his kids,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.830
let's call it your reward, shall we?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.400
I have a question for you.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.270
Did you really think Father had dementia?

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.210
Or did you know he was pretending
and just played along?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.480
- What kind of answer are you looking for?
- The truth.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.010
But then again,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.080
that's impossible, isn't it?

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.680
It would be difficult
for you to be honest.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.220
Seeing as you have so many secrets.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.710
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.950
This is the budget proposal
for the live commerce event.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.880
We'll schedule the first broadcast
as soon as the budget is approved.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.720
Are you really not going to tell me?

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.920
Who's broadcasting on the other channel
at the same time?

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.390
Curious?

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.190
That's not it. I need to know
so I can split up the team.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.660
Once the schedule is set,
my team splits to provide support,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.500
- but we can't without knowing the host.
- Go to the CEO's office.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.940
You'll find my competition there.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.240
And based on the results
of this broadcast,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.970
a very important position will be decided.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.940
An important position?

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.620
What are you doing here?

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.860
So, does this mean you're in the running
for the CEO position?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.460
It's a temporary position, but yes.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.000
It's a little strange seeing you in here.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.440
So, what brings you here?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:35.240
By any chance,
are you and Min Kyung Chae...

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.340
going to be running channels
at the same time?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.410
They set it up, so I didn't have a choice.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.420
They want to see who's more qualified
based on our sales figures.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.190
Like it or not,

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.960
I'm competing for the CEO position.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.130
You'll use a pro host, but you must also
be directly involved in the show, Lucia.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.660
Have the products been selected yet?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.400
We're putting a list together.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.600
If we're on different channels at once,
we can't sell the same products.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.870
Please get me the project proposal
and all related materials.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.740
Will do.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.680
She must be out of her mind.
Does she really think she can beat you?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.050
Whether it's pride or greed,
the results will speak for themselves.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.020
It's not like home shopping with a studio
or professional broadcasting equipment,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.260
so in the end, it all comes down to...

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.430
- what products you're selling.
- Of course.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.570
The date and time for the first broadcast
will be set soon.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.500
The person competing against
Min Kyung Chae...

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.210
is Lucia.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.710
Really? Wait, how did Lucia get involved?

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.080
The chairman's wife?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.110
What? Who decided that?
On whose authority?

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.390
We're splitting into two support teams,
so everyone needs to be ready.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.360
And what about that list I asked for
of online products we could sell?

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.030
From categories like clothing, cosmetics,
kitchenware, and home decor,

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.700
I've selected only our
top-selling products.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.630
So, Director,

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.840
who are we supposed to be rooting for?

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.970
We need both channels
to be a huge success.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.480
This is our first live commerce event,
so we need to smash our sales targets.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.250
Then our online team can get a nice bonus.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.690
And, Vice Director,
head over to the Director's office...

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.990
and get me the product list
from the chain store team.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.520
Is it true? Kyung Chae and Lucia
are going head-to-head?

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.390
Don't even get me started.
This whole thing is a mess.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.130
Kyung Chae is desperate for the CEO job,
and Lucia is no pushover, either.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:45.600
But I have a feeling this is all part of
Father's grand plan.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.440
What's that supposed to mean?

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:51.910
What if he wants to make Lucia the CEO,
so he faked having dementia to test us?

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.680
Who knows what he's thinking?

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.380
Here's this year's product list
for the chain stores.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.790
What is this nonsense?

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.890
Mingang Distribution
is grasping at straws.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.260
What are your in-laws up to now?

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.460
You wouldn't understand if I explained.
They're doing live commerce.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:17.930
That's why I'm asking you to explain it.
Is it something you eat or wear?

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.470
Please. You don't know what it is either,
you're just pretending.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.470
What do you mean I don't know?
They're doing live commerce!

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.140
In other words,
they're doing live commerce.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.680
Then explain it better.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.720
I am explaining it!
Mingang Distribution does live commerce!

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.790
Live as in, raw commerce.
You know... Stella.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.460
What? Stella?

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.360
Mom...

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.560
Oh, hey. I wasn't expecting you.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.000
I just saw my husband
and was on my way home.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.760
How are your in-law doing?

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.330
More than okay.
He's practically flying around.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.740
I still don't get
why he faked having dementia.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.140
Oh, and by the way,
my husband was just saying...

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.780
our company's stock is about to go up.
Dad, hold on tight to those shares.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.550
But you're the one who said not to sell.
You said Ji Seop would need it, right?

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.520
We need to at least have that.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.020
Looks like he's the only one losing out.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.290
What kind of cockamamie story is this?
What's happened to Ji Seop?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.990
It means your son-in-law
isn't getting the CEO position.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.360
Worried Min Kyung Chae won't give it up?
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.200
You never know what'll happen.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.000
You're right. You never know.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.940
Who'd have thought the CEO position
would go to his young wife?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040
What?

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.940
What the...

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.910
Wait, he's giving the CEO position to who?

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.820
You handsome old geezer!

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.580
My sexy old lady!

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.250
Oh, gosh.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.850
The online team's products are...

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.490
padded jackets, jewelry,
and beauty products,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.030
and home decor.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.700
Well, it's a pretty safe lineup.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.930
They already have brand recognition
and have sold well.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600
Not bad.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.300
I agree.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.640
The chain store team has
fresh-crop rice, a meat set,

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.480
and bathroom supplies,

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.510
and a spicy seafood stew meal kit.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.520
A spicy seafood stew meal kit?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.390
The host will have to try this on air,
won't they?

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:18.960
I would assume so.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.830
Wow, this broth is incredible.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.030
Come on.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.800
Just have one bite.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.640
What's the big deal? It's just one bite.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
No, I'm fine.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.310
What if I end up in the ER again
like last time?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.580
Then we should've just had
ramyeon at home.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.710
Why did we even come out?

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.650
You're the one who was craving this.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.290
Don't worry about me. You eat up.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.130
I hope our baby takes after you, not me.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.100
What if they get my seafood allergy?

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.730
Perfect.
Let's go with the spicy seafood stew kit.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.870
Tell Lucia to try and sell this.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.140
I have a feeling this is going
to be interesting.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.250
(Spicy Seafood Stew Meal Kit)

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.710
A spicy seafood stew meal kit?

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.550
Why? Is there a problem with it?

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.220
I have a severe allergy to it.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.020
Even a small taste causes
a full-body reaction.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.090
Then we'll take it off the list.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.860
We can't risk you having
an accident on air.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.000
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.240
Have you made a decision?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.640
I plan to schedule the broadcast
as soon as the products are selected.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.140
The online products are mostly fine,
but...

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.750
among the products
from the chain store team,

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.620
let's remove
the spicy seafood stew meal kit.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.080
Why?

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.220
Director Min Soo Jung
specifically requested that product.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.160
No matter how I look at it,
I don't think it's right for broadcast.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.630
Unsuitable for the broadcast?

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:09.330
Retail's first rule. Sell what you get,
no matter how odd it seems.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.170
To just say you can't or won't do it
without a convincing reason...

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.840
That's just not acceptable.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.510
Wouldn't you agree?

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.850
Of course, if you really can't do it,
we can take it off the list.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080
But then again,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.080
this isn't just any project.
The CEO position is on the line.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.620
It just looks petty.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.290
Trying to play it safe like this.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.620
No.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960
We'll do it.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.730
Don't take it out.
We'll proceed as planned.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.020
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.760
(Filming with the infant was conducted
with parental supervision...)

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.860
(and with full consideration
for the baby's rest and safety.)

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.110
I don't know what you're planning,
but you won't get your way.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.810
What do I do now?
I'll lose out because I got involved.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.750
He just hasn't gotten his big break.
If my husband just gets a chance,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.210
I know he could do great things.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.880
They're not trying to pull something,
are they?

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.450
Yell at them, threaten them. I don't care.
Just do whatever it takes.

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.390
I would rather die than see you succeed.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.990
Just you wait.
I'll see this through to the very end.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.900
