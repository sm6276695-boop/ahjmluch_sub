00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.159
You

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.599
Who are you, really?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.879
Brother

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.959
I heard things have been dangerous around Qinning Mountain lately.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.319
Let's take a break.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.360
Then leave as soon as we can.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.919
We better not run into those monsters.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.080
Bah, what bad luck.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.080
I've traveled all over for years.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.879
Never heard of anything like Rotten Ones.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.000
Those monsters are so rotten,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.159
yet they can still attack people.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.639
Don't say that at night.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.400
Or they'll come for you.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.639
It's not that creepy.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:35.479
Th-this...

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.439
Miss, slow down when you eat.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.400
Don't choke.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.840
Yeah, miss.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.639
People can scare others to death.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800
Especially looking like you do.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240
Sir, I didn't mean to.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.400
I was just too hungry.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.599
We've got plenty of food.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.599
We can give it all to you.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.400
But you have to do as we say.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.039
Let us brothers take good care of you.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.919
Miss

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.759
Why are you running?

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.439
Let us brothers take good care of you.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.960
There's no one around for miles.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.400
That's right.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.080
It's just the two of us left.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.120
Hurry, chase her!

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.039
Brother

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.840
We should get out of here.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.840
This place gives me the creeps.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.800
No way.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.840
I haven't had any fun in half a year.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.919
I'm not letting this chance slip away.

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.879
You ate my food,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.680
so now you belong to me.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.720
That's right.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.800
Let's see where you run now.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.759
And then?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.879
I heard those two

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.040
were bitten to death.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.560
They say the Rotten Ones

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.439
start rotting from the belly.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.240
When they're dressed,

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.639
you can't tell just by their faces.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.079
Who knows,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.759
they might be hiding among us.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.720
It's just that we

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.959
haven't noticed.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.399
Sorry to intrude.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:28.279
Who are you?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.560
And who are you?

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.519
We are...

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.759
We're outsiders.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.360
May I ask,

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.160
why are you all up so late?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.959
Gathered here like this?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.160
What's the occasion?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.680
An occasion?

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.759
This is a major event.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.240
It's Xuancheng's Fire Sacrifice Festival, held every three years.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.199
We parade the gods and hold rituals.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.120
Praying to the Fire God for peace all year.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.160
And a bountiful harvest.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.240
Senior brother

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.279
You really owe me a thank you.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.000
I'm the top fighter of Yun Yin.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.160
If I hadn't arrived in time,

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.839
and dug you out of that pit,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.519
you wouldn't be seeing this now.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.920
Thanks, I'll treat you to buns later.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.120
Thank you, senior brother.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.000
Master is so unfair.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.639
Didn't even bring us to such a fun place.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:29.680
If you ask me,

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.319
Master just doesn't want to leave.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.839
Here they come!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.040
The Chosen One to light the fire today

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.839
is the Crown Prince, Nan Zhengqi.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.560
He's Xuancheng's most favored son.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.959
Who's that sickly one beside him?

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.319
He was injured fighting Mocheng.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.600
That's the Second Prince, wounded in the leg.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.519
Nan Zhengci

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.000
Bumpkin

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.079
The once legendary brave youth

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.199
has ended up like this.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.879
What a pity.

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.319
Such a shame.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.399
The auspicious hour has come.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.319
The auspicious hour has come.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.920
The fire is lit.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.319
May the weather be favorable.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.759
May all the people be safe.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.199
What are they doing?

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.279
The royal heirs offer their blood as a sacrifice.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.199
To show their sincerity.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.360
Praying for the gods to bless the nation's prosperity.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.600
Praying for divine protection.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:50.960
Praying for divine protection.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.840
Everyone, be careful.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.440
Luobo, help them quickly!

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.360
Run! Run! Run!

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.559
Protect the princes!

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.120
Second Prince, what's happening?

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:09.799
Protect the First Prince!

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.840
Zhengci

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.039
Zhengci, help me!

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.039
Zhengci

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.120
Help!

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:53.480
Close the net.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.039
We haven't figured it out yet.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.360
And you just burned it like that.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.759
You look unfamiliar. Who are you?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:18.919
Me?

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.360
Take a guess.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.559
What are you doing here?

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.039
What's your purpose?

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.159
With that attitude of yours,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.639
are you planning to take me down too?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.279
That's exactly my intention.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.679
Move aside! Move aside!

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.320
Move! Move! Move!

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.080
Move!

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.720
Move!

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.679
If you resist again, I won't be so polite.

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.440
Are you alright? Did you get hurt anywhere?

00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:36.600
No.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.399
Senior brother, are you okay?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.080
I'm fine. What about you?

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.000
I'm fine too.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.080
City Lord, something's wrong!

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.240
The Rotten Ones have appeared again!

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:04.039
They not only disrupted the Fire Sacrifice Festival,

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:05.679
they almost killed the three young masters.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.039
Rotten Ones?

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.679
Like me?
