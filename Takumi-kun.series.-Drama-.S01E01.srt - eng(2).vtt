00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.560
I love you.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.790
Takumi.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.590
I know.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.760
Stop it. Look forward.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Forward.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.050
What's wrong? Don't you believe me?

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.510
- That I'm in love with Takumi.
- That's not it!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.570
Hey, Saki Giichi!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.770
What are you whispering
about with your neighbor?

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.530
Stand up.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Yes.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.940
Saki.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.370
What is the population of Moscow?

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.410
I've never been to
Moscow, so I wouldn't know.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.300
Oh, is that so?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.720
Then what places do you know?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.960
Well...

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:53.376
The United States, Japan,
the UK, France, Ireland, Austria.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.349
Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Sri Lanka.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.470
And...

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.880
You may sit down.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.330
But be quiet.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.870
Yes.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.510
Now then.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.070
Regarding population
migration after World War II...

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.890
It can be broadly divided into
migration to the Americas and to Russia.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.470
Of these, immigration to Russia...

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.446
because Russia shares a land
border with many European countries...

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.110
the circumstances were rather unique.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.300
(Mouthing) I love you.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.890
This school, nestled
deep in the mountains...

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.050
is an isolated, all-boys boarding school.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.720
Its name is Shido Gakuin High School.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.880
The school was founded...

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.220
in the early Showa period.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.660
I hear that it once only admitted...

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.540
the sons of prominent families.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.850
But now, even boys
from ordinary families...

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.000
study here side by side.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320
Hey, Takabayashi.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.570
This is for the exhibition.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.260
Ah, thanks.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.820
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

(Student Council Room)

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.170
Compared to when it
was first established...

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.100
its aristocratic atmosphere...

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.020
has faded considerably.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240
However...

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.700
among them...

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.070
is a transfer student
from the United States.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.020
An extraordinarily wealthy young man.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.190
Saki Giichi.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.200
Known as...

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.410
Gii.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.560
That Genda...

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.650
he always has it out for me.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.110
He calls on me at least once every class.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.610
Well, maybe you shouldn't do things
that make the teacher mad.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.690
But I just want to tell
you I love you, Takumi.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.770
You say it so often...

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.840
it sounds like you're kidding.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.880
Takumi.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.020
I'm serious.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.260
I know.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.510
Then right here...

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.880
kiss me.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100
Huh?!

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.860
Well?

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.270
Go on.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.550
I don't want to die yet.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.030
Why would you die?

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.410
Gii has absolutely no idea.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.020
My high school life...

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.940
has already been turned
completely upside down.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.950
That's right.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.620
It all started on that day.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.040
When I became a second-year...

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.090
the dorm roommate assignments were posted.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.430
Huh?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.940
What am I going to do?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.330
Just by being Gii's roommate...

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.770
I'm already getting a
ton of unwanted attention.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.220
And on top of that...

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.340
if people find out that
Gii and I are a couple...

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.210
Hey, if you don't hurry, we'll
lose our seats in the cafeteria.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.600
You're right, Akaike-kun!

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.540
Let's go.

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.750
- Hey! Wait up, Takumi!
- Don't run.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.859
Let's go, Takumi! Hurry!

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.600
I told you, don't run.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
(Takumi-kun Series)
(Episode 1)

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.070
This is rare.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.500
You're not with Gii.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.300
Well...

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:47.020
Gii and Akaike-kun are still...

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.440
You're as predictable as ever.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Never mind that.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.470
You'd better not get too close to Gii.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.056
Otherwise, people might get the
wrong idea about your "relationship."

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.280
"The wrong idea?"

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760
Friends with benefits.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.020
You know, sex partners.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.650
Friends with...

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.630
You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.470
Gii and I just happen to be roommates, and
happen to be the class and vice class presidents.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.526
But you and Gii are alone in your room every night.
There's no way people will believe nothing's happening.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.790
If you fooled around with
every roommate you had,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.840
things would be a total mess.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.270
Gii is different.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.250
Huh?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.240
Don't tell me...

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.500
Nogawa-kun.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.720
You have a thing for Gii?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.820
That's not what I said.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.350
Hayama.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.390
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.660
Oh.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.460
Here, this is for you, Takumi.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.870
Thanks.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.890
Thanks for the food.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.050
Me and...

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.380
Gii are friends with benefits...

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.640
Is that how everyone sees us?

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.650
Come in.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.890
Excuse me.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.499
Not you again, Shingyoji.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.920
Working late, Arata-san.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.570
I don't recall giving
you permission to enter.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.470
Stay back.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.180
I can't let you see these documents.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.300
Sorry.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.700
Working overtime again?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.820
It's routine.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.760
The student council has a ton of work.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.260
The other members already
went home for the day.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.430
Oh, I see.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.880
Arata-san.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.210
Any plans for Golden Week?

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.090
Didn't you hear me?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.270
I probably can't go home.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.790
You too, right?

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.270
Yes.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.560
I have to train hard for
the summer tournament.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.730
The main players are
second and third-years,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.910
but first-years still have a shot.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.080
Don't get discouraged. Keep it up.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.790
- Yes! I'll do my best!
- Stop.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.580
Do not come within two meters of me.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.920
Ah.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.190
Sorry...

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.630
Wait for me, Arata-san!

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.219
Arata-san! Arata-san!

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.939
Please don't ignore me, Arata-san!

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.900
Let's go back to the dorm together!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.960
Stop.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.930
Listen up.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.700
From now on, do not invade
my personal space. Ever.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.690
Goodbye.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.290
That's so harsh...

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.890
Arata-san.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.600
By the way, what's "personal space"...?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580
Ah.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.920
Hello.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.580
I remember...

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.850
That boy...

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.920
He's a first-year...

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.150
Takumi.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.270
Toshihisa.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.370
I've been worried about you.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.969
We were roommates during our first year,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.730
so I could still look out for you.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.380
Yeah.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.490
I'm grateful.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.030
You were the only one,
Toshihisa, who treated me kindly.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.780
You were in pretty bad shape
during your first year, Takumi.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.580
You would go ages without saying a word.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.450
And you got all those weird nicknames.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.850
Emotionless.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.970
Apathetic.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040
Cold-blooded.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.090
Even human-hater and germaphobe, right?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Yeah.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.790
Ah, sorry.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.190
That was a bit blunt of me.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.920
Bringing up things you're sensitive about.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.460
It's the truth, though.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.710
But you know...

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.680
when I heard who your
roommate was this year...

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.020
that it was the Gii...

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.300
I thought it was going to be a disaster.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.800
But now, I'm actually relieved.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.390
Huh?

00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:07.510
Because...

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.219
with someone like Gii...

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.570
I doubt he'd be swayed by any rumors.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.560
And I feel like he's someone
who can really understand you.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.720
So, how is it?

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.580
Are you and Gii getting along?

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:22.710
Yeah.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.900
I guess...

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.980
it's going okay.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.490
That's a relief.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.390
Takumi, aren't you going to take a shower?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.900
Oh, um...

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.030
I still have a little homework
left. I want to finish it up.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.890
Homework?

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.650
We have homework?

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.290
Oh...

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.560
An English essay.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.650
You're so lucky your
English is good, Giichi.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.330
I was in the States until I
was 15, so of course it is.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.900
Can I borrow your pen?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200
Sure.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.220
Here.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.120
Let's see...

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.580
This sentence is really well-written.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.090
But a different word
might work better here.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.010
For example...

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.410
Instead of "unclean"...

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.070
try something like "dirty."

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.020
Hey, aren't you going to bed?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
Hmm...

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.490
Pretty soon.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.890
Let's get some sleep.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540
Just a little longer.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.950
I've been letting my schoolwork
slide because of club activities.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.210
Well then...

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.830
I'm going to head to bed first.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.540
Okay.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.560
Yeah, you go ahead.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.300
Oh, sorry.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.800
You won't be able to
sleep with the light on.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.450
There's still some time before lights out.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.900
I'll go work in the common room.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.870
Good night.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.220
'Night.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.280
What's his deal?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.720
Yoshizawa, you idiot.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.820
Morning.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.510
Good... morning.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760
Hey, wait up.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.660
You're...

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.650
You're Hayama Takumi, aren't you?

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.530
Yes.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.550
And you know who I am, right?

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.690
No...

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.690
I'm sorry.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.300
Well, I can't let you go
until you get to know me.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.210
Whoa, hold on...

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.470
Relax, I'm not gonna bite.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.070
See? I just wanted to ask you out.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.690
It's an invitation to a date.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.840
I appreciate the offer, but...

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.869
I'm not interested.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.590
Come on, wait.

00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:37.630
Hey, Takumi!

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.520
What's going on?

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:40.930
Oh.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120
Giichi.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.760
I'll ask you out again later!

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.900
That guy...

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.780
The captain of the
third-year basketball team...

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900
Nozaki.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.000
(Disciplinary Committee Room)

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.530
Excuse me.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.030
Oh, Akaike.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.056
Sorry for calling you in
during your lunch break.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080
It's no problem.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.640
So, what did you need to see me about?

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.000
It's about our first meeting.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.556
As the committee chairman, I'd like to make
a list of things we need to do beforehand.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.140
Have a seat.

00:16:26.141 --> 00:16:28.080
Oh, pardon me.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.850
Could you give me a hand with that?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.510
Of course.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.160
Ever since last year...

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.842
I guess I'm the only weirdo
willing to do a thankless

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:37.546
job like the Disciplinary
Committee two years in a row.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.570
I suppose so.

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:40.925
Well then, let's make that list.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.780
Let's see...

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.940
First off...

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.020
We should probably put together
an agenda for the meeting.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.980
Right.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.530
What else?

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.423
For the school rule
patrols, we go in pairs.

00:16:57.448 --> 00:17:00.740
It might be a good idea to
decide on the pairings beforehand.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.850
- I see.
- Yes.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.500
Takumi.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.380
Pass me another roll.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.980
Sure.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.610
That's your fourth one, you know.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.630
Thanks.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.450
That guy Genda...

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.580
He seems to be holding a grudge,
ordering me around all the time.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.420
I'm starving because of him.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.610
Do you want another one?

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.530
I've already eaten, so...

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.690
You're the best!

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.590
Ah...

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.430
Finally, I'm full.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.720
Hey, Takumi...

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.450
Yeah?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.930
Let me rest my head on your lap.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.690
Huh?

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.840
I just want to rest a bit.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.050
Wait, Giichi...

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.170
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not asking for a kiss.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.330
We're a couple, aren't we?

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.376
What's the big deal about me
resting my head on your lap?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400
Huh...

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.520
Just this is more than enough for me...

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.810
Mm.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.580
Thanks.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.870
Giichi...

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.290
For so, so long...

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.030
I always felt like he was from a
world completely out of my reach...

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.220
For us to be like this...

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.460
How long can it possibly last?

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.670
This relationship of ours...

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.080
One day, I'm sure...

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.260
we'll have to go our separate ways...

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.600
Huh?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.460
Takumi...

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.770
Oh, is lunch break over?

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.830
No...

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.780
That was...

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.080
the bell for the end of fifth period.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.260
Oh no, fifth period was English.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.069
I'm already so bad at it.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.950
If the teacher gets on my case again...

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.540
What am I gonna do...?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.570
Takumi.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.070
In that case, let's just
skip sixth period too.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.710
Don't be ridiculous.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.590
We have to go back.

00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:33.630
Everyone's probably
talking about us by now.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.350
Talking about what...?

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.540
Isn't it obvious?

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.420
Us disappearing together for an hour.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.170
About what Takumi...

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.350
and I were doing.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.340
Oh...

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.916
- We should go back separately.
- That'll just look more suspicious.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.220
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.280
Good question.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.070
Instead of letting them make things up...

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.310
why don't we give them
something real to talk about?

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.880
What do you mean by that...?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.100
Let's enjoy ourselves so
much we lose all track of time.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:15.730
See ya, Giichi!

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.060
You've got some nerve, Hayama.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.050
Grades aside...

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.136
I never thought someone as serious
and straight-laced as you would skip class.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.870
No, it's just that...

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.240
By the way, where's Giichi?

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.220
He was with you, wasn't he?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520
No, he wasn't.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:47.930
Hmm.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.060
So, where were you?

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.590
Uh, I accidentally fell
asleep in the courtyard.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:58.780
I see.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600
In that case...

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.710
I'll be sure to confirm
that with Giichi later.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.490
I completely fell for
Akaike-kun's leading questions.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.710
Akaike-kun...

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.920
Just how much does he know about us?

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.650
In any case, from now on...

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.370
I have to be more careful.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.360
Past tense...

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.610
Past perfect.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.750
What does that even mean?

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.390
It's better to use "used to" here.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.900
Huh?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320
Oh...

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520
Oh...

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800
I see.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.190
You've got a scientific mind, Takumi.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.406
It's part of your
obsession with cleanliness.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.190
You can't rest until you've found
a definitive answer for everything.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.580
- That's not true...
- Yes, it is.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.410
You can't help but put a label on everyone.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.930
"This guy is just a classmate..."

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.680
"This one is just an acquaintance..."

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.920
"And this guy is just my roommate."

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.646
When it comes to how other
people's feelings might change...

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.070
you choose to ignore it, don't you?

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.659
Giichi, what are you talking about...?

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.180
Because your own feelings
never change, Takumi,

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:15.690
you just assume no one else's do either.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.030
Giichi...

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.170
Like what happened today...

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.530
You hated the idea of people
thinking we were together.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.570
That's why you ran away, isn't it?

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.709
Because I do hate being misunderstood!

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.280
Don't be an idiot! I'm
in love with you, Takumi!

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.209
What man in this world...

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.780
can stay indifferent
to the person he loves?

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.080
Have you ever once stopped
to think about how I feel?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.960
I'm sorry... Giichi.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.060
If "sorry" is all you can say...

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.180
Takumi...

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.030
Giichi?!

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.630
I love you.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Takumi.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.430
Stop it, Giichi!

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.760
Giichi is always true to his own heart.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.530
But I...

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.760
I don't even understand my own feelings.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.150
Why...

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.980
Takumi...

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.130
Besides...

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.540
there's a reason...

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.820
why I can't...

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.090
move forward.
