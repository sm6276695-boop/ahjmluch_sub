00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.560
Second Brother, Zhu Sheng

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:03.920
Why are you here?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.480
I was worried about you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.359
Tonight your life is at stake.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.599
How could I stay at the Princess's manor?

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.079
Of course I want to be with you.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.480
No, tonight is extremely dangerous.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:15.719
Let Zhu Sheng take you back now.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.359
No.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.480
If you don't protect me in this city,

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.560
my days will be even harder.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.719
How could I abandon you when you're in trouble?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.959
I appreciate your concern.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.120
But you must go back.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.760
Yes, Princess Nan Zhengyue.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.040
The young master has to worry about you too.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.799
Don't worry, I'm here.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.120
Who cares about the Wraith King?

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.719
No harm will come to the young master.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.120
Well... all right then.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.120
This is a new Warding Sachet I made for you.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.159
It wards off evil and keeps you safe.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.000
Are you satisfied now?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.120
Can I leave now?

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.680
I also made you a special herbal soup.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.079
I'll leave after you drink it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.159
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.120
Heavens protect us, heavens protect us.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.520
Heavens protect us, heavens protect us.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.560
Hey,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.719
why do you keep fiddling with that Shadow Coin?

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:21.919
It's not even worth a jug of wine.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.680
Go away, you don't get it.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.159
This Shadow Coin has a big story.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.639
Let me tell you,

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.400
my grandmother took this coin from a corpse's coffin.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.080
She took it out herself.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
It's full of dark energy.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.319
I hope it can ward off tonight's evil.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.800
Let me touch it too!

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.719
Hey,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.319
we're really unlucky, aren't we?

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.000
Yeah.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.639
We got assigned to the second young master's manor.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.680
I haven't even found a wife yet.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.360
You're still thinking about marriage?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.159
Surviving tonight would be lucky.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.479
Protect me, please.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.840
What?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.520
Did your grandmother ever say

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.840
what to do if the Shadow Coin cracks?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.879
That's a terrible omen.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.280
A terrible omen, for sure.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.560
Protect me, please.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.879
Protect me, protect me, protect me.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.159
Looks like we've fallen into a trap.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.080
Search.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.680
Did something happen here?

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.360
I don't know anything.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.600
Come out.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.879
If you don't want to die with us,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
then stay back.

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.759
It's the young princess.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.519
What now? Do we kill or not?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.639
Who are you people?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.240
Why do you want to harm my brother?

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.399
Didn't expect the timid little girl

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:14.439
to be so tough.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:15.800
She's actually pretty fierce.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.319
You know who I am,

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.040
and even my personality.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.319
You must be from the palace.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.839
Why bother talking to her?

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.720
It's a trap.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.720
Tell me, where is Nan Zhengci?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.839
I don't know.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.399
Stubborn.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.120
If we kill you, he'll have to show up.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.000
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:08.720
Damn.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.199
Princess Nan Zhengyue, are you all right?

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.680
I'm fine.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.959
Where's the second young master?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.800
Say something!

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:39.160
Second young master.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.199
You arrived just in time.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.120
Protect Nan Zhengyue.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.079
Let's fight our way out.

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.000
Run!

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:51.959
Go!

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:52.639
Chase them!

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.399
Go!

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.120
I told you so.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.759
In this world,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.279
there's no such thing as a deadly Wraith King.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:11.279
Just evil people pretending to be monsters.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.759
Tell me, who sent you?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.720
Speak up.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:16.480
Maybe you'll get to keep your lives.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.560
Enough talk.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.319
Still stubborn at death's door.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.920
Be smart, end yourselves.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.680
You'll suffer less that way.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.240
It's not clear who'll win yet.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.160
Attack!

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.639
Open the door! Open the door!

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.959
Quick, block the main gate!

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.279
Come on, move it!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.039
Brother, move aside!

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.840
No, this won't work for long.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.080
They'll break in sooner or later.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.679
We won't die with these monsters, will we?

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:56.320
Brother.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.600
That would be too tragic.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.919
Young master, princess.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.639
I'll rush out first and draw them away.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.879
You two escape when you can.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.639
You go, I'll cover you.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.159
Are you crazy?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.440
Second young master.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.200
You gave me my life.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.639
For both young masters,

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.240
Zhu Sheng's life is worth sacrificing.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.879
No, that's not right.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.559
Second Brother and I won't allow it.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.440
Brother, why did they suddenly leave?

00:09:59.279 --> 00:09:59.759
Let's go.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.360
Go check.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.039
Where are they heading?

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.120
Protect Nan Zhengyue.

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:31.480
It's dawn.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.960
They're heading back to their lair.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.480
Quick, follow them!

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:55.879
Second young master.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:58.080
Do you know what's ahead?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.039
This is the Frigid Forbidden Land.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:02.360
It is shrouded in deadly cold all year.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.159
A place of extreme cold and darkness.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.960
No one has ever come out alive.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.440
When the sun rises,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.960
the Corrupted hide inside here.

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.120
This is likely the Corrupted's lair.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:24.200
Look.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.679
I understand now.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.159
Sunlight burns the Corrupted.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.120
So during the day,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.120
they hide in this frigid place.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:45.720
They only come out together at night.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.440
That makes sense.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:49.960
I have a plan.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.000
Only my little brother truly cares.

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:03.799
Don't worry.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.559
Once your sister returns,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.559
no one will dare bully you again.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:10.879
By the way,

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:12.679
is the second brother dead?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.360
That girl Nan Zhengyue

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.679
has hidden the second brother away.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.519
And at his residence,

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:21.159
a lot of The Corrupted appeared out of nowhere.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.440
They've thrown the whole plan into chaos.

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.919
Well played, Nan Zhengyue.

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:28.799
You dare go against us siblings.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.000
Just wait and see how I deal with you.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.039
How dare you!

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.559
You worthless dogs!

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.480
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.159
Search the residence.

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:42.399
You—
