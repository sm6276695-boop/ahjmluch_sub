00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:45.816
One million six hundred thousand.

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.256
Going once.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.256

Three million.

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:00.215
Three million?

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:02.536
Three million?

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:03.575
That's a lot.

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:09.136
Three million.

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:10.736
Any higher bids?

00:02:10.775 --> 00:02:11.856
Final call then.

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:13.616

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:15.056

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:29.535
Try it on.

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:30.136
Okay.

00:02:30.136 --> 00:02:30.576
Okay.

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.215
Next, let me introduce
our second auction item.

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:37.016
Qinghua porcelain vase
with dragon and lotus motifs.

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.176
As you can see here.

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:41.176
It features elegant shaping
and fluid lines.

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:42.815
With centuries of history,

00:02:42.815 --> 00:02:44.056
it remains well-preserved.

00:02:49.576 --> 00:02:50.176
Lei.

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:54.375
Does it look good?

00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:58.176
Quite exquisite.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:01.016
You like it?

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:06.336
I can't give you this one.

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:12.495
But this one is fine.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:17.576
No need.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:18.456
Don't move.

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:20.176
Auctions

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:22.655
are just excuses for show.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.975
Charity's the real purpose.

00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:26.640
Kindness matters most.

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:28.495
That's why you won't find

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:29.935
real treasures here.

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:35.775
You think it's worth three mil?

00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:39.655
Take it if you like it.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.935
It suits you.

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:45.176
Isn't it lovely?

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:47.215
So beautiful.

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:49.016
It was made for you.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:50.456
It's yours now.

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.016
Let's go, dear.

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:54.935
What a trinket.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:57.552
What else do you like?

00:03:58.224 --> 00:03:59.408
I'll bid for it next round.

00:03:59.935 --> 00:04:01.016
Know your limits.

00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:02.495
Be gracious.

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:03.655
You said it.

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:04.935
Remember to smile.

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:06.215
Ms. Xu, hello.

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:06.815
Mr. Shen.

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:07.815
What an enviable couple.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:09.935
So beautiful.

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.215
Hello, Ms. Xu.

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:12.255
Mr. Shen.

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.736
Good evening, viewers across the nation.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.176
Welcome to Financial News.
I'm host Xu Yan.

00:04:24.176 --> 00:04:28.375
Groundbreaking ceremony of Jinda Group's
Huanyu International real estate project

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.216
successfully concluded today.

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:33.776
This 300,000 square meter development

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.335
features not only luxury residences,

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.656
but also international-grade
office towers

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:39.056
and premium shopping complexes.

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:42.015
It's crowned as Jinda Group's
flagship endeavor.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:44.375
(Good evening, everyone.)

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.216
(This is Entertainment Frontline.)

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.375
(At Jinda Group's recent
groundbreaking event,)

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.096
(we met picture-perfect newlyweds.)

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.736
(They sweetened our screens.)

00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:54.255
(Shen Haoming, Xu Yan, a couple's quiz)
(Sugar overload warning!)

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:56.455
(You maintain such marital bliss.)

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:57.616
(Any secret formula?)

00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:58.895
(Share with our audience.)

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:06.616
(No secrets here,)

00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:09.856
(just good fortune.)

00:05:10.856 --> 00:05:11.695
(Then comes)

00:05:12.056 --> 00:05:15.695
(mutual admiration between partners.)

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:17.736
(I respect her capabilities,)

00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:19.736
(but most commendable is that)

00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:23.495
(despite having easier career options)

00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:25.495
(or even choosing domestic life,)

00:05:26.495 --> 00:05:29.695
(she pursued her childhood dream.)

00:05:45.096 --> 00:05:46.736
Yan, your tea.

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:52.296
First time seeing a host report
on her own husband's business.

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.216
You two look perfect together,

00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:55.815
just like a match made in heaven.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.935
Your husband clearly adores you.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:03.976
Yan, are you tired?

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:08.695
Take a breather then.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.135
I'll monitor the edits.

00:06:11.736 --> 00:06:13.096

Hello, Grandma.

00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:34.416
Yan,

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.855
how have you been lately?

00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:42.056
Why do you ask?

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:45.656
Nothing.

00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:51.296
I just saw you on TV.
You looked a bit unhappy.

00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:56.215
I'm just worried you're going
through some trouble.

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:03.056
If I'm overthinking it...

00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:06.176
I'm glad you're okay.

00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:07.615
Good that you're okay.

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:15.136
(Yan)
Everything is fine.

00:09:15.735 --> 00:09:16.656
Don't worry.

00:09:18.256 --> 00:09:18.855
Okay.

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:20.416
That's good.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:22.935
Yan,

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:28.656
you've had such a tough journey
building your career.

00:09:29.776 --> 00:09:32.296
Now that you've found a job you love,

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:34.896
you must cherish it.

00:09:36.416 --> 00:09:38.335
Whether it's work

00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:39.896
or personal life,

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:41.695
be down-to-earth.

00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:43.016
As for me,

00:09:43.536 --> 00:09:44.695
I'm getting old.

00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:51.095
I won't be around much longer, right?

00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:53.455
Don't talk like that.

00:09:57.656 --> 00:09:59.935
I'll take leave next week

00:10:00.176 --> 00:10:01.615
and spend more days with you,

00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:02.496
okay?

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:05.776
No need, really.

00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:07.575
If you have time for a vacation,

00:10:07.735 --> 00:10:09.095
find a nice place

00:10:09.416 --> 00:10:12.575
and travel with Haoming.
That'd be lovely!

00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:15.776
Take lots of photos to show me.

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:18.016
I'd be so happy.

00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:23.095
We have plenty of time together.

00:10:27.776 --> 00:10:29.455
I just miss you.

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:34.695
I want to come home.

00:10:38.056 --> 00:10:39.855
I miss you too.

00:10:46.776 --> 00:10:50.776
Do you want to have a child?

00:10:52.176 --> 00:10:56.215
I want a great-grandchild.

00:12:29.575 --> 00:12:30.136
Grandma.

00:12:35.896 --> 00:12:36.656
Grandma!

00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:41.095
Grandma!

00:12:51.536 --> 00:12:52.256
Yan,

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:53.935
- you're finally back!
- Hello, madam.

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:56.016
Your grandma fainted last night.

00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:58.256
We rushed her to the county hospital.

00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:00.615
County hospital?

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:02.695
Your parents went too.

00:13:15.536 --> 00:13:16.095
Yan,

00:13:16.416 --> 00:13:16.935
you're here.

00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:18.016
Check on Grandma.

00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:20.376
Grandma.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:25.496
Grandma.

00:13:25.896 --> 00:13:26.335
Yan.

00:13:26.855 --> 00:13:27.376
Yan,

00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:29.215
don't worry.

00:13:30.215 --> 00:13:31.056
The doctor said

00:13:31.296 --> 00:13:33.575
she had transient cerebral ischemia.

00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:35.615
Luckily, we brought her in time.

00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:37.416
She's stable now.

00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:39.016
She'll be fine.

00:13:43.136 --> 00:13:44.296
When will she wake up?

00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:47.016
She's just weak,

00:13:47.335 --> 00:13:48.656
and needs rest now.

00:13:58.176 --> 00:13:58.935
You can go home.

00:13:59.136 --> 00:13:59.855
I'll stay.

00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:02.095
Let's all stay together.

00:14:04.416 --> 00:14:05.296
I'll be fine here.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.335
Okay.

00:14:15.776 --> 00:14:17.776
We'll relieve you tomorrow morning.

00:14:24.575 --> 00:14:25.656
If anything happens,

00:14:25.815 --> 00:14:27.095
call us, okay?

00:14:56.496 --> 00:15:00.735
(At this moment, I decided
to divorce Shen Haoming.)

00:15:03.176 --> 00:15:04.656
(If not for maintaining lies,)

00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:07.496
(Grandma could've seen me
in a wedding dress.)

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:10.136
(If not for maintaining lies,)

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.575
(Grandma should've been by my side,)

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:14.896
(rather than collapsing
alone and helpless.)

00:15:16.776 --> 00:15:19.136
(My only chance to make amends)

00:15:20.176 --> 00:15:23.815
(is to completely end the lies myself.)

00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:49.735
Who told you to come back?

00:15:55.296 --> 00:15:56.095
You're awake.

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:58.575
Still feeling unwell?

00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:03.056
Have some water.

00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:06.256
Come on.

00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:07.536
Small sips.

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:09.735
Small sips.

00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:12.776
Don't choke on it.

00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:19.855
Are you feeling okay?

00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:21.256
Yes.

00:16:22.176 --> 00:16:22.935
Yan,

00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:26.176
raise my bed a bit straighter.

00:16:26.455 --> 00:16:27.815
Why? It's the middle of the night.

00:16:27.815 --> 00:16:28.575
Just sleep.

00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:29.935
Just do it.

00:16:39.896 --> 00:16:40.855
- It's okay.
- Okay?

00:16:41.095 --> 00:16:42.056
Okay.

00:16:49.455 --> 00:16:50.256
Yan.

00:16:52.656 --> 00:16:53.975
Something's bothering you.

00:16:55.776 --> 00:16:57.136
Tell me about it.

00:17:01.935 --> 00:17:03.256
Come back to Jingzhou with me.

00:17:06.736 --> 00:17:07.655
Once you're discharged,

00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:09.135
we'll go pack your things, okay?

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.855
I've lived in the countryside
my whole life,

00:17:13.696 --> 00:17:16.536
and I enjoy the peaceful life here.

00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.175
I know.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:20.095
So I've thought it through.

00:17:20.615 --> 00:17:23.135
We can rent a place with a small yard

00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:25.095
in the suburbs of Jingzhou.

00:17:25.536 --> 00:17:27.575
You can grow flowers and plants there,

00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:29.415
just like you do now. How's that?

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:33.415
That does sound nice.

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.736
I know you're worried about me,

00:17:39.496 --> 00:17:43.736
but working alone in the city
must be so hard for you.

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:48.936
I just want you
to live your own life well.

00:17:50.175 --> 00:17:53.615
Your happiness is my happiness.

00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:02.415
I'm doing fine.

00:18:02.696 --> 00:18:03.736
Don't worry about me.

00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:10.216
Folks like us from the countryside

00:18:10.976 --> 00:18:13.175
are used to living in old houses

00:18:13.855 --> 00:18:15.456
and doing farm work.

00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:18.615
Suddenly moving away

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:19.655
and settling

00:18:20.415 --> 00:18:22.855
into a big city house

00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:25.575
would leave me feeling lost.

00:18:26.016 --> 00:18:28.976
My whole being would feel uneasy.

00:18:31.135 --> 00:18:31.936
Got it.

00:18:34.135 --> 00:18:35.655
I'll sleep now. You should leave.

00:18:59.456 --> 00:18:59.895
Mr. Shen,

00:19:00.016 --> 00:19:02.135
the legal risk report
requires your signature.

00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:08.536
Mr. Shen,

00:19:09.095 --> 00:19:11.976
I have some information about your wife.

00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:13.415
Go on.

00:19:14.095 --> 00:19:15.655
She is looking for a divorce lawyer.

00:19:17.375 --> 00:19:18.335
She won't divorce me.

00:19:20.095 --> 00:19:23.016
I recommend making early preparations,

00:19:23.415 --> 00:19:24.175
just in case.

00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:26.448
Now's critical for her job confirmation.

00:19:27.095 --> 00:19:28.175
She's worked so hard

00:19:28.415 --> 00:19:29.496
for that position.

00:19:30.296 --> 00:19:31.655
She won't give it up now.

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.855
Nor will she abandon
everything she's achieved.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.286
(Shen Haoming)

00:20:04.656 --> 00:20:06.591
(Divorce Agreement)

00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:08.976
Let's get divorced.

00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:15.256
Didn't we clarify everything last time?

00:20:15.855 --> 00:20:16.736
What do you want now?

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.095
I'll leave with nothing,

00:20:20.736 --> 00:20:21.895
not taking a cent from you.

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:29.655
Xu Yan, you know very well

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.375
that once we divorce, the luxury cars,

00:20:33.976 --> 00:20:34.536
mansions,

00:20:34.976 --> 00:20:35.696
chauffeurs,

00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:36.415
maids,

00:20:36.855 --> 00:20:37.456
designer goods,

00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:40.415
and all Shen family resources

00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:41.815
will be stripped from you.

00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:43.216
They were never truly mine.

00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.296
And I don't need them anymore.

00:20:52.895 --> 00:20:55.175
Or do you think
now that you have your career

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.415
and that host position within reach,

00:21:00.335 --> 00:21:01.736
you can afford to be reckless?

00:21:07.095 --> 00:21:07.815
Mr. Zhou,

00:21:09.496 --> 00:21:10.696
as we previously agreed,

00:21:10.855 --> 00:21:11.536
my sponsorship

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:12.696
will be postponed.

00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:17.256
Should I send it?

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.216
(Fang Lei)

00:21:39.312 --> 00:21:40.216
(Audio Recording)

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.016
What do you want?

00:21:45.855 --> 00:21:46.415
Fang Lei,

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:49.615
I'm warning you
to stop harassing my husband.

00:21:49.615 --> 00:21:50.536
(Cancel)

00:21:50.536 --> 00:21:51.936
If you have any dignity,

00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:54.456
disappear from our lives.

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:56.256
Who are you to order me?

00:21:57.976 --> 00:21:58.895
I put the past down

00:22:00.256 --> 00:22:01.776
to your youth and immaturity.

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.615
But if you keep this up,

00:22:06.655 --> 00:22:08.696
you're deliberately
destroying a marriage.

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:15.575
If your parents also have any dignity,

00:22:17.175 --> 00:22:18.335
I advise you to stop.

00:22:18.736 --> 00:22:19.496
Is that a threat?

00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:22.655
(Fang Lei)
Xu Yan, let me be frank with you.

00:22:23.056 --> 00:22:26.095
I returned just to be with Haoming.

00:22:26.296 --> 00:22:28.696
I don't care if he's married.

00:22:28.976 --> 00:22:31.175
I made myself clear last time.

00:22:31.415 --> 00:22:33.536
Haochen is Haoming's son,

00:22:33.776 --> 00:22:35.855
and I'm Haochen's aunt.

00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:38.056
I've already won this battle.

00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:40.736
(End)
The one clinging to the Shen family...

00:22:41.855 --> 00:22:45.575
Do you want an amicable divorce,
or a fight to the bitter end?

00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:48.536
The choice is yours.

Where will you move?

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:12.016
There are divorce procedures

00:23:12.736 --> 00:23:14.936
and documents requiring your signature.

00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:16.375
I'll text you the address.

Thanks to my two kind
and beautiful treasures.

00:24:04.655 --> 00:24:07.496
That six-hour midnight session
was absolutely perfect

00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:08.456
and unforgettable.

00:24:09.256 --> 00:24:10.895

Should I treat you?

00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:14.615
Why going to your place?

00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:15.615
You'll see.

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:16.895
We came to pick you up.

00:24:36.776 --> 00:24:38.895
Perfect. Let me update you
on her recent progress.

Her teacher said she's
attentive in class lately.

00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:43.895
No more skipping school,

00:24:43.895 --> 00:24:44.936
and has become humble

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:46.296
in seeking help.

00:24:47.216 --> 00:24:48.536
Her grades have really improved.

00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:50.415
Thanks.

00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:53.456
Please keep looking after Qiao Lin.

Don't worry.

00:24:56.615 --> 00:24:57.335
Why not go in?

00:24:58.696 --> 00:25:00.335
I saw her leave.

00:25:01.216 --> 00:25:03.175
I have something to
attend to. I'm leaving.

00:25:03.536 --> 00:25:05.296
Alright.

00:25:05.415 --> 00:25:06.776

The previous tenant just moved out

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:17.175

00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:28.736
If anything comes up, just call me.

00:25:28.855 --> 00:25:29.655
Thank you.

00:25:29.815 --> 00:25:30.296
It's okay.

(Director)

00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:38.615
Hello, sir.

00:27:39.256 --> 00:27:39.815
Yiming,

00:27:40.175 --> 00:27:41.895
the next surgery is in the next week.

00:27:42.335 --> 00:27:43.815
This is a high-risk procedure.

00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:45.496
As you know, the patient's family

00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:47.615
has reservations about you.

00:27:48.016 --> 00:27:49.895
So failure isn't an option here.

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:52.575
Otherwise, the malpractice fallout
alone will ruin you.

00:27:54.056 --> 00:27:54.976
Understood, sir.

00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:56.776
Get some good rest.

00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:41.335
What are you doing?

00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:42.335
Stress relief.

00:28:48.895 --> 00:28:50.575
Still worried about the surgery?

00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:53.575
Then come with me.

00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:54.536
Where to?

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.855
We've got six hours until dawn.

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:58.456
No point wasting time here, right?

00:29:00.056 --> 00:29:01.232
Seriously, what's your plan?

00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:02.335
Come on, I don't bite.

00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:03.016
Come.

00:29:03.256 --> 00:29:04.375

Hello.

00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:48.135
Ms. Xu, I haven't seen you in ages.

00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:49.736
What service would you like today?

00:30:49.976 --> 00:30:51.575

00:30:51.575 --> 00:30:52.815

00:30:53.392 --> 00:30:55.312
- No.3, come down.
- Can I cancel my membership?

00:30:57.615 --> 00:30:58.375
Ms. Xu,

00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:00.256
was our service unsatisfactory?

00:31:00.335 --> 00:31:02.256
You're not switching
to our competitor, are you?

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:03.536
Ms. Xu,

00:31:03.615 --> 00:31:05.256
please share any complaints.

00:31:05.335 --> 00:31:05.736
We'll...

00:31:05.976 --> 00:31:07.496

00:31:10.175 --> 00:31:10.696
Thank you.

Ms. Xu,

00:31:20.736 --> 00:31:22.056
your refund is processed.

00:31:22.536 --> 00:31:23.135
Thanks.

00:31:28.936 --> 00:31:29.696
Excuse me,

00:31:30.415 --> 00:31:32.655
I didn't get the refund notification.

00:31:32.776 --> 00:31:34.575
Could you double-check?

00:31:35.952 --> 00:31:37.712

they were paid.

(Hengyue Law Firm)
That guy

00:31:54.175 --> 00:31:55.655
is 19 years younger than my mom.

00:31:55.976 --> 00:31:57.335
At first, he sweet-talked my mom

00:31:57.375 --> 00:31:58.575
to buy him houses and cars.

00:31:58.615 --> 00:31:58.976
Alright.

00:31:59.175 --> 00:32:01.615
After succeeding, he started
coveting our family's shares.

00:32:02.135 --> 00:32:04.456
This young wolf sure knows his tricks.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.696
My mom's currently blinded by passion.

00:32:07.696 --> 00:32:08.976
But I won't stand for it.

00:32:09.175 --> 00:32:11.655
I need to protect my own interests.

00:32:12.095 --> 00:32:12.815
Mr. Qiu,

00:32:12.976 --> 00:32:14.615
regarding my portion of the assets,

00:32:14.655 --> 00:32:15.615
what should I do?

00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:16.575
We've noted

00:32:16.575 --> 00:32:17.496
your requests.

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.415
We'll draft the contract
and email it to you by tomorrow.

00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:22.256
We can talk again if there's a problem.

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:23.776
I have three strategies.

00:32:29.056 --> 00:32:30.335
Is that man earlier

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.536
a lawyer?

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:32.696
Mr. Ding

00:32:32.855 --> 00:32:33.895
specializes in divorce.

00:32:34.135 --> 00:32:35.496
He's famous in legal circles.

00:32:35.696 --> 00:32:37.216
He handles only top-tier clients.

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.135
Divorce lawyer?

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.776
Did Yan's
field interview schedule change?

00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:54.976
I haven't heard anything.

00:32:55.855 --> 00:32:57.296
Yan is not just asking for leave,

00:32:57.536 --> 00:32:59.056
she's asking for an extended leave.

00:32:59.615 --> 00:33:00.615
You didn't know that?

00:33:00.936 --> 00:33:03.216
Why would she take an extended leave
all of a sudden?

00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:06.175
Could it be some big news

00:33:06.536 --> 00:33:07.335
about a baby?

00:33:07.976 --> 00:33:10.216
I heard she's getting divorced.

00:33:11.175 --> 00:33:12.415
Could there be an affair?

00:33:12.936 --> 00:33:14.175
I really don't know.

00:33:14.936 --> 00:33:16.256
I said nothing.

00:33:32.776 --> 00:33:33.456
Come in.

00:33:36.016 --> 00:33:36.696
Haoming.

00:33:39.696 --> 00:33:40.415
Where's Mr. Fang?

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:43.256
I had my father's secretary
tell you this.

00:33:45.415 --> 00:33:46.056
Haoming,

00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:46.976
Haoming.

00:33:48.095 --> 00:33:49.655
Don't you always keep things business?

00:33:49.855 --> 00:33:50.216
Okay.

00:33:50.415 --> 00:33:51.736
Let's discuss business then.

00:33:52.095 --> 00:33:54.415
My father and I contributed
to the New District project.

00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:56.696
A business dinner
isn't unreasonable, right?

00:33:57.456 --> 00:33:59.056
Is this really necessary?

00:34:00.016 --> 00:34:01.056
I heard you're divorcing.

00:34:06.855 --> 00:34:07.815
It seems true.

00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:11.295
I heard she hired a lawyer.

00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:14.896
I knew it.

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:16.056
Someone like her

00:34:16.416 --> 00:34:18.255
only pretends to love you.

00:34:18.615 --> 00:34:20.135
Once realizing she can't control you,

00:34:20.135 --> 00:34:21.376
she finds escape routes,

00:34:21.496 --> 00:34:22.416
maximizing her gains.

00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:24.175
Haoming.

00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:25.255
Yan,

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.655
the interview's in the executive lounge
on this floor.

00:34:28.135 --> 00:34:29.175
The guest will come

00:34:29.175 --> 00:34:30.175
after makeup.

00:34:34.735 --> 00:34:36.336
When will you see clearly?

00:34:36.416 --> 00:34:38.095
I'm the one who truly loves you.

00:35:36.695 --> 00:35:38.016
Before my divorce,

00:35:39.135 --> 00:35:40.255
you're the other woman.

00:36:00.775 --> 00:36:01.896
How could she hit me?

00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:04.695
Xu Yan, stop right there!

00:36:09.775 --> 00:36:10.976
She's right.

00:36:13.056 --> 00:36:14.376
Who said we're divorced?

00:36:17.416 --> 00:36:20.056
Couples quarrel sometimes, okay?

00:36:20.416 --> 00:36:24.295
You're the Fang family heiress.
You can't be the other woman.

00:36:25.255 --> 00:36:26.336
Think carefully.

00:36:27.775 --> 00:36:28.735
Stop bothering me.

00:37:16.456 --> 00:37:16.976
Yan,

00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:20.896
there've been rumors lately

00:37:21.536 --> 00:37:24.336
that you and Mr. Shen
are getting a divorce.

00:37:25.536 --> 00:37:27.416
Everyone's buzzing about it.

00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:30.056
Even the management
are discreetly asking.

00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:32.295
I'm sure

00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:34.856
Sun Siwei started these rumors.

00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:36.655
But Yan,

00:37:37.295 --> 00:37:39.936
your move to host the evening news

00:37:40.295 --> 00:37:42.456
was practically confirmed.

00:37:42.976 --> 00:37:45.936
Now suddenly they favor Sun Siwei

00:37:46.456 --> 00:37:48.816
and start the restructuring

00:37:48.896 --> 00:37:50.496
to cut some shows.

00:37:50.856 --> 00:37:54.095
Family Feast's sponsors
are meddling too.

00:37:56.856 --> 00:38:00.655
I heard they secretly contacted
Sun Siwei's team.

00:38:03.016 --> 00:38:03.536
Yan,

00:38:06.416 --> 00:38:07.295
really divorced?

00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:11.695
You scared me.

00:38:11.816 --> 00:38:12.655
I knew it.

00:38:12.735 --> 00:38:13.775
You two were so close.

00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:14.615
How's this possible?

00:38:15.215 --> 00:38:18.775
But occasional arguments
between couples are normal, right?

00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:21.095
Don't worry about it.

00:38:21.936 --> 00:38:22.735
Go back to work.

00:38:23.135 --> 00:38:23.655
Alright.

00:38:23.816 --> 00:38:24.856
I'll get back to work.

00:38:26.255 --> 00:38:26.816
But listen,

00:38:27.536 --> 00:38:29.215
handle any issues properly.

00:38:29.376 --> 00:38:30.496
Don't act impulsively.

00:38:32.575 --> 00:38:33.735
Xu Yan, the star host.

00:39:12.095 --> 00:39:13.536
Aren't you working today?

00:39:17.095 --> 00:39:18.095
You saw me?

00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:23.175
I'm just concerned about you.

00:39:23.416 --> 00:39:25.016
After you secured the host position,

00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:27.175
I was going to buy flowers to celebrate.

00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:28.655
But look what happened.

00:39:29.336 --> 00:39:32.095
News about your divorce
is spreading everywhere.

00:39:33.135 --> 00:39:34.496
The situation looks bad.

00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:36.896
You never fix your issues.

00:39:39.735 --> 00:39:41.215
I've told you countless times.

00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:45.536
Focus on your own work.

00:39:46.936 --> 00:39:48.016
Then it won't be like this.

00:39:49.376 --> 00:39:50.615
Such a hypocrite.

00:39:50.735 --> 00:39:52.135
Focus on yourself?

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.056
You really think your hosting skills

00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:58.016
made others concede defeat?

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:05.816
I don't know if they

00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:06.655
concede defeat.

00:40:09.376 --> 00:40:09.976
But you...

00:40:23.775 --> 00:40:25.816
You used your husband's connections

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:28.456
to invite those elites
to Family Feast, didn't you?

00:40:28.496 --> 00:40:30.135
Otherwise, who would even know you,

00:40:30.175 --> 00:40:31.536
let alone talk to you?

00:40:32.095 --> 00:40:35.615
You only got this position
because your husband

00:40:35.735 --> 00:40:38.215
struck a deep strategic deal with them

00:40:38.416 --> 00:40:40.735
and built up trust with them.

00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:43.416
They say they concede defeat,

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:45.016
but it's not you they respect.

00:40:45.056 --> 00:40:46.416
It's your husband.

00:40:46.775 --> 00:40:49.536
Now that divorce rumors
have just started,

00:40:49.536 --> 00:40:50.976
your position's already crumbling.

00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:51.735
Xu Yan,

00:40:52.575 --> 00:40:53.936
think carefully.

00:40:54.775 --> 00:40:57.255
What's truly yours?

00:41:41.095 --> 00:41:41.775
Hello?

00:41:42.735 --> 00:41:44.695
Xu Yan, come to my office.

00:41:48.336 --> 00:41:48.936
Okay.

00:41:51.416 --> 00:41:51.936
Xu Yan,

00:41:52.856 --> 00:41:53.976
we received an anonymous tip

00:41:54.376 --> 00:41:56.575
about you falsifying family background.

00:41:57.056 --> 00:41:58.175
What's going on?

00:42:01.215 --> 00:42:01.936
Sir,

00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:06.295
I'll resign.

00:42:07.496 --> 00:42:08.135
Why?

00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:10.295
Your marriage really...

00:42:10.816 --> 00:42:12.016
Nothing to do with my husband.

00:42:16.255 --> 00:42:22.336
I'm just tired.

00:42:38.496 --> 00:42:40.936
(The key is controlling the heat.)

00:42:41.175 --> 00:42:43.095
(Oil temperature matters too.)

00:42:43.215 --> 00:42:44.896
(Should beef use higher heat?)

00:42:46.056 --> 00:42:47.695
(It depends on the cut.)

00:42:49.456 --> 00:42:50.016
(You also...)

00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:51.735
(Inviting you was clearly
the right call.)

00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:54.575
(Okay, your dishes are nearly ready.)

00:42:54.615 --> 00:42:58.456
(The studio's filled with aromas.)

00:42:58.735 --> 00:43:01.215
(These scents make me homesick.)

00:43:07.775 --> 00:43:09.976
(All my career achievements)

00:43:10.896 --> 00:43:12.575
(were just fleeting illusions.)

00:43:12.624 --> 00:43:16.574
