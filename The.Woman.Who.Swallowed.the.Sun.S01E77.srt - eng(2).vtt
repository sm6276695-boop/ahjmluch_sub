WEBVTT

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.880
Why are you doing this to me?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.580
What did I do to deserve this?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.520
You're wrong for lying to your kids.
Why am I the one being punished?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.290
Let go! Get off me!

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.920
Take a good look at yourself.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.390
Before you blame your children,
you need to take a good look at yourself.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.530
I will never let that woman
take the CEO position.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.730
Over my dead body!

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.170
Let go!

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.940
I said, let go! Get off me!

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.710
Let go!

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.310
I said, let go!

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.350
Let me go. I said, let go, you jerks!

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.550
Let go!

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.350
- Let go of me!
- Get your hands off her this instant.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.170
Ma'am.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.570
You can all go now.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.880
Please, calm down. Let's not do this here.
Everyone is watching.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.720
Hey, Soo Jung!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.460
You will not believe what I just saw.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.020
What? What did you see?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.930
Kyung Chae was dragged from her office.
It was a complete madhouse.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.860
Who had her dragged out?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.700
Who do you think?
I knew this would happen from the notice.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.040
Dad?

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.340
Did he really have to go that far?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.040
I guess it just shows
how determined he is.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.310
I'm sure
the directors on her side protested,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.450
but he's bulldozing it through anyway.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.220
So he's really going
to make Lucia the new CEO?

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.190
That's what Dad wants. What can we do?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.860
Be patient.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.070
You have to be patient for now.
Fighting back now will only backfire.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.540
So you're telling me I should just work
as a regular employee?

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.640
The Chairman posted an official notice.
Doesn't that show he won't back down?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.880
Aside from the Chairman testing you
by faking his illness,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.650
the fact is, he has something on us.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.620
Think about it.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.220
If he'd have you dragged from your office,
there's nothing we can do about it now.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.360
But the board is against it.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.860
Sure, the board might help.
But they can't call a meeting right away.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.030
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- Now is the time to lie low.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.800
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to get you your CEO position back,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.470
so for now, you just have to bear with it.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.850
Do you think Kyung Chae will be fired
and that woman will take her place?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.390
What are you talking about?

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.190
Come on. Yesterday, Kyung Chae
got wasted and yelled at her father.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.490
She asked if he was happy giving it all
to "that woman."

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.700
She's going to hear you
if you keep calling her "that woman."

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.900
So what? She's not even here.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.170
Come on, people badmouth anyone
when they're not around.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.700
Anyway...

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.910
The way things are going,
it's like this is her kingdom.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.940
At this rate,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.950
I wouldn't be surprised
if he gives her the Chairman's seat too.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.210
He wouldn't.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.820
Kyung Chae won't be forced out as CEO,
so don't you worry.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.560
As if anyone could change his mind.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.160
I never thought I'd see the day.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.030
I should've been there to see Kyung Chae
get dragged out with my own two eyes.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.970
What a satisfying sight that must've been.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.070
It still needs the board's approval.
It won't happen overnight.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.810
That's just a formality.
What can they do if he forces it?

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.380
It's not like
Lucia isn't qualified, either.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.050
Once Chairman Min's shares
are officially transferred to me,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
then it'll be a different story.
For now, I'm just going to wait and see.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.760
If I make a move now,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.230
it will only make the directors
on CEO Min's side bolder.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.590
Good thinking.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.230
But how much of his shares do you think
Min Doo Sik will give you?

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.940
The size of the stake you're getting
is going to change things for us.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.370
I'm not sure.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.440
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.380
To put her in the CEO's chair,
I have to give her enough to justify it.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.150
But if I give her everything,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.020
those brats of mine will band together
and stand in my way.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.360
Every single one of those brats...

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
Soon, my shares will be transferred
to your account.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.370
I'd give you more, but it's not a lot.
Only about seven percent.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.070
That's more than enough. Why so much?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.540
It's not too much at all.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.580
You'll need at least that much leverage
when you take over as CEO.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.650
Are you really going to make me CEO
instead of your daughter?

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.450
Did you think I was joking?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.520
Someone who's always scheming for my job
doesn't deserve to be in that position.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.790
She won't be able to handle going from CEO
to a regular staff member overnight.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.360
If she can't handle it, then so be it.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.060
She made her own bed.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.570
You're just getting in?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.110
Where's my father?

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.140
In his room.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.590
I'll do as you say.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.930
Let's just say this makes up for
what I did to you.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.130
I'm willing to start over from the bottom.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.500
Oh, you're doing me a favor now?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.670
The brat who tried to throw her own father
in a nursing home now wants to negotiate?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.540
Then what do you want from me?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.170
Will you hold this over my head forever
and never see me again?

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.240
- I'd like nothing more.
- Do you really have to say it like that?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.010
Do you know what it's taking for me
to give up the CEO position?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.850
You should take her offer.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.020
How can a father not see his own child?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.090
Especially when she's willing
to go this far.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.160
The bond between a parent and child
is sacred, no matter how angry you are.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.560
You shouldn't try to break a bond
that's meant to be.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.670
You're the one ruining that sacred bond.
The one between my father and me,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.940
and the one between me and Se Ri.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.910
Who do you think is causing all of this?

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.820
Fine, have it your way.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.920
I'll start over from the bottom.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.150
So, Father, you can drop it now.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.890
How brazen...

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.590
Darn it.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.840
- Why are you pretending I'm not here?
- Because you were talking nonsense.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.410
What did I say?

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.110
You don't even remember.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.310
Then again, I'm not surprised.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.490
Never say something so ridiculous again.
It's disgusting.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.160
What's with her?

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.090
Oh, come on, hurry...

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.660
You messed up with Se Ri last night.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.560
Why would you say something like that?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.600
What did I say?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.670
That you're her birth mother.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.000
It's not like you were claiming to be
the Queen of Joseon.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.310
I said that?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.140
You were so drunk, she probably thinks
you were rambling.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.080
Luckily, she didn't seem
to take it too seriously.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.780
Actually, this might be a good thing.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.680
I'll use this chance
to tell her everything...

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.250
and get Se Ri away from that woman.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.090
You've kept it a secret for so long.
Why do this now?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.120
Is stepping down as CEO
the end of the world?

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.190
You have to get it back.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.230
You can't afford a single weakness.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.000
They could use your past against you
to stop you from making a comeback.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.230
This isn't the right time.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.250
I don't care how drunk you were.
What kind of nonsense was that?

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.180
Don't you ever say that again.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.520
How could you say
that you're Se Ri's birth mother?

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.220
She came to me so upset.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.720
And why is that so nonsensical?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.030
Do you know how disappointed and shocked
Se Ri is with you right now?

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.660
She's disappointed in me?

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.200
You tried to put her father in a home.
Of course she's disappointed.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.300
How much longer are you going to be
sleeping in her room?

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.210
She can't sleep without me.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.450
She's fragile and needs looking after.
Otherwise, she'll get into trouble.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.650
And why does that someone have to be you?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.420
It's not my choice. It's what Se Ri wants.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.220
How can you still be so clueless
about everything?

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.200
(Official Notice: Min Kyung Chae Dismissed
as CEO, Demoted to a Staff Position)

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.120
You made the right choice.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.120
It's best to wait out the storm.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.860
Now is the time to lie low for a while.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.930
Just stay out of the way for now
and plan your next move.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.930
I'm telling you, don't be so upset.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.300
You'll be back before you know it,
so don't worry.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.370
I'm just stepping away for a bit,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.440
so don't let anyone take my seat.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.770
Of course.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.810
It's your seat. Who would dare?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.680
You think I would just stand by
and let that happen?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.230
Did everyone see the official notice?

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.960
You think CEO Min
is really going to join our team?

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.600
Come on. No way.
CEO to staff overnight? It's insane.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.570
If they posted an official notice,
it has to be true, right?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.440
- Vice Director Min, what's going on?
- How am I supposed to know?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.810
Still, demoting the CEO
to a staff member is going too far.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.410
That's what I was thinking.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:45.480
Really? I thought it was real.
Then why put up the official notice?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.790
All right, that's enough chitchat.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.220
Do you think CEO Min will work
as a staff member? She has too much pride.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.330
She'd sooner quit.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.490
If what you guys are saying is true,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.660
then the CEO would leave her office
and come slinking in here like some...

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.780
She actually showed up.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.840
What are you gawking at?
Am I an animal at the zoo?

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.150
Get back to work!

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.990
CEO Min, my mistake.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.030
Today, Kyung Chae...

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.130
joins the Online Business Team
as a staff member, right?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.970
She reports to you, so train her properly.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.010
I will accept your special order.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.810
However, a transfer that breaks procedure
could be problematic.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.780
Don't worry.
I'll follow the procedures from now on.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.610
Don't favor her because she was CEO.
Work her hard.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.920
She has to earn her keep.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.150
In that case, what if she leads
the live commerce project?

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.560
Do what you want.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.790
All she's ever done is
give orders from behind a desk.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.690
She's never had
to get her own hands dirty.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
It's your call.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560
Very well.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.430
So, will the CEO's position
remain vacant for the time being?

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.900
It won't be empty for long.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.300
I intend to fill it soon.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.180
All right, everyone.
I have a directive from the chairman.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.110
Our newest team member, Min Kyung Chae,

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.420
will be taking an active role
in all aspects of our team's work,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.650
so I expect all of you
to assign her tasks without hesitation.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.490
Are you ready for that?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.030
Also, the person in charge
of our new live commerce launch...

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.800
has been selected,
and that person is Min Kyung Chae.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.730
So I'll need everyone's cooperation.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.470
Livestreams on a distribution platform...

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.410
requires a different approach
than traditional home shopping.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.480
And one more thing.
We have a team tradition here.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.350
The new hire picks the lunch spot
and handles tea time.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.620
Just so you know.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.190
And...

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.630
Why aren't you responding?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.660
Am I supposed to answer
every single thing you say?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.430
Of course you are.
If your boss asks a question, you answer.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.970
That's how corporate life works.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.610
- What can I get for you?
- Two goat soups, please.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:27.880
Two goat soups!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.320
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.850
Look at everyone enjoying the food.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.890
Eating well is what it's all about.
Enjoy the soup and keep your strength up!

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.260
I'm glad business is booming, but...

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.660
But what?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.730
For business to be this good
in a recession like this,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.370
you should be thanking your lucky stars.
What's there to complain about?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.400
That's just human nature, isn't it?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.110
You earn a little,
and then you want to earn a lot more.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.240
Is that old itch of yours acting up?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.950
You're just looking
for your next big investment,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:01.950
getting all wide-eyed again,

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.780
What a mouth on my beautiful wife.
A wife is the earth, and I'm the sky.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.120
Oh, please. The sky's high, but worthless.
Land is what's expensive these days.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.820
What kind of crazy talk is that?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.120
Have you ever seen land without a sky?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.860
Oh, whatever.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.560
Don't even think about investing.
Now, opening another store is different.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.570
We can open another store and invest.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.830
Why not do both?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.940
You'll get obsessed with it and ruin us.
You don't even know what you're doing.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.170
Besides, you already have those shares
in Mingang Distribution.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.880
A measly 2 percent? Come on.
You have to trade to make real money.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.650
Oh, honestly! Ja Kyung told you before.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.090
She said to hold onto the company shares
to help Ji Seop when he's in need.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.320
Excuse me.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.360
- Oh, yes.
- I'm ready to order.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.320
We're just not on the same level.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.830
That's why I keep thinking
about Ms. Stella.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.400
We're a perfect match in sophistication.
And she could be my business partner.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.170
We could build a friendship.
And once that friendship builds,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.170
affection starts to build.
And once affection builds, well...

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.570
I'm not sure what happens next.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.540
Director Moon.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.950
I think we're due for a caffeine run.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.810
Oh, is it?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.080
New hire, what are you doing?

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.290
Aren't you going to get the coffee?

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.460
Are you asking me to do that?

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.390
Well, who else would do it?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.700
The director said it earlier.
On this team, the newest member...

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.270
gets it.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.140
Oh, here's the card.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.410
Everyone can just get their own coffee,
or don't, if you don't want any.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.980
Why are we acting like children?

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.480
We're not acting like kids.
This is how you build team chemistry.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.020
That's right.
We all did it when we were new.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.820
Do you really think I'm the same as you?

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.020
Come on, why is everyone acting like this?
Give it to me. I'll go get it.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160
Hang on a second.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.960
This is a task for the new hire.
Why can't you do it?

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.730
And what exactly makes you so different
from the rest of us, Ms. Min?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.270
Please hurry. Everyone's waiting.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.290
So you're saying the Chairman already
transferred the shares to her account?

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.960
It looks like it was gifted immediately
on his special orders.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.190
So if she takes the CEO position,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.990
she'll have a stake in the company
as part of the owner family,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.060
and become a legitimate executive.
Darn it!

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.430
Don't worry too much.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.600
It's not like a huge part
of the shares was transferred.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.500
Maybe, but you never know
when that geezer will change his mind.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.110
Okay, I get it.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.970
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.180
What do we do?

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.280
A portion
of the Chairman's shareholdings...

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.920
has been transferred to Lucia.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.690
So he's already transferred shares to her?

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.130
Then all that's left is
for him to make her CEO.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.960
What the heck are the directors doing?
Those idiots.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.730
Why did those directors
rush into the chairman's office...

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.130
when they couldn't even stop him?

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.180
If you have 7 percent,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.610
your stake is the same
as Min Soo Jung and Min Ji Seop's.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.950
Even so, it won't be a major threat
to Min Kyung Chae.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.720
But Min Doo Sik will pressure the board
and the shareholders...

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.290
to put you in the CEO's seat.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.290
The board and the shareholders
will never accept me.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.160
You never know about that.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.000
There's the Helena Louise contract.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.400
It's clear you've made major contributions
since you were on the online team.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.070
Do you think that will be enough?

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.070
I feel I need one decisive achievement
to win over directors and shareholders.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.780
Why isn't Min Kyung Chae back yet?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.550
She left to get coffee a while ago.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:32.920
I'm not sure.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.380
Maybe she got lost?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.190
Why are you empty-handed?

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.690
What happened to the coffee?

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.260
I'm not in the mood
to be running coffee errands.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.130
So you just came back without it?

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.200
Quiet down. I need to think.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.740
- Hey, Min Kyung Chae.
- I said, be quiet.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.980
Excuse me! Did you just yell at me?

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.550
Why do you keep addressing me so casually?
Are we friends or something?

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.950
What are you doing now?
Is it okay to disrupt the office this way?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.720
Can't you see they're the ones
ruining the atmosphere, not me?

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.420
Ms. Min, were you such an amateur...

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.360
with no sense of hierarchy or structure?

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.790
What did you just say? Amateur?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.030
Are you done?

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.730
If a lone wolf who can't work with a team
isn't an amateur, then what is?

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.640
Let's have a word.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.510
What is your problem?

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.380
Now that you're on our team, you need
to at least try to adapt and fit in.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.450
I have no reason to adapt
and no need to fit in.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.050
I'll be getting my CEO position back
soon enough.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.660
Should I repeat myself?

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.700
I'm going to be CEO again soon,
so don't you dare underestimate me.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.230
Even if you do get your old job back,
don't forget you work for me right now.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.240
If you keep this up,
I can't guarantee a good review.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.910
- You're threatening me with that?
- It's a warning.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.210
And just so you know,
this team has a three-strikes rule.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.810
Three warnings and you're out.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.450
Keep that in mind.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.100
What are you up to?

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.600
Just thinking.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.940
Are you still upset about
what Kyung Chae said?

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.610
It was just a drunken rant.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.050
I don't think
it was just the alcohol talking...

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.180
You're nothing like her.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.090
If anything, you take after me.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.720
- Me?
- Yes.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.130
You know how when we smile,
our eyes and mouths look just alike?

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.790
And that's not all.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.560
We're always on the same wavelength, too.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.230
I guess you're right.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.340
And the clincher is,
you have a seafood allergy, right?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.170
So do I.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.840
We were probably mother and daughter
in a past life.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.850
That must be why we get along so well.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.680
So just forget what your sister said.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.460
At this rate, all my hard work
will be for nothing.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.160
After everything I did to take in Se Ri...

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.230
and how I saved that helpless newborn
when she was dying.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.170
I'm sure...

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.740
she has ulterior motives
when it comes to Se Ri.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.310
Director Moon.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.010
It's time to go home.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.820
Is it that time already?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.250
All right, everyone, pack up and go home.
Great work today.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.890
- Good work today.
- You too.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.920
- Have a good night.
- I'm heading out.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.030
I'm heading out now. Good work today.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.740
Where do you think you're going?
You're not even halfway done.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.370
You need to finish it before you leave.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.110
Are you telling me to stay here
and finish this all by myself?

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.250
If you'd worked like everyone else did,
you wouldn't be behind.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.250
Even if you have to pull an all-nighter,

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.980
you're finishing this before you leave.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640
Nicely done.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.340
What time did you leave last night?

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.110
I stayed behind and worked by myself
until the sun came up.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
See?

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.380
These dark circles.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.490
Go get this approved by Director Min.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.300
For your approval.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.240
I'm not signing this.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.140
What?

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.180
If you want my approval, do it right.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.010
Go back out and knock first.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.850
What do you think you're doing?

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.580
Min Kyung Chae.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.390
This is a workplace.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.750
What?

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.460
"Min Kyung Chae?"

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:41.490
People only sucked up to you
when you were the CEO.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.860
How dare a mere staff member
talk that way to the Director?

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.400
A vacant CEO position looks bad,
and it creates a gap in our operations.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.610
And with the online team's livestream
about to launch,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.610
we need someone to sign off on things.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.120
The board won't approve it.
They'll say it's a unilateral decision.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.980
Who are they to refuse my decision?

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.090
I'm the owner, and I'm the chairman.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.090
But this is a corporation. You can't just
do whatever you please, sir.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.760
They can easily object if you try
to install someone unqualified.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.630
You were a team leader
when you first joined this company.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.770
You stopped working when you got married,
but you never officially resigned.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.100
That's only because
you've been so gracious.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.810
If I approve of you,
then so will everyone else.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.280
I'll handle the board.
You just accept the new CEO position.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.320
Sure.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.120
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.730
Didn't I tell you last time?

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.940
Forgiveness is what the powerful
give the powerless.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.270
Come in.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.920
- Let go of me!
- Wait.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.390
I insist on returning what I get.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.040
Let me go!

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.910
This is where it all started.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.510
If you had just sincerely apologized
back then,

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.110
if you had felt any remorse for
what you did to my Mi So,

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.120
I wonder where we'd be now.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720
Ma'am.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.190
Let me take care of this.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.160
You should go get some rest.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.730
You look exhausted.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.860
Tell me about it. I'm exhausted.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.670
I should report him
to the Ministry of Labor.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.340
That Director Moon Tae Kyung
is a real piece of work.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.850
What are you doing here?

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.720
You should have apologized properly
back then.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.220
You have a daughter of your own.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.150
Would you have done the same...

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.890
if something had happened to Se Ri
instead of my Mi So?

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.690
I asked you what you're doing!

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.060
This is going to be my office soon,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.060
- so I'm getting a feel for it.
- Who said this is your office?

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.000
Get out. Now.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:12.840
I said, get out!

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.640
I think you're the one
who's going to have to leave, not me.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.090
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.440
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.320
Set your personal feelings aside, sir.
You'll damage your hard-earned reputation.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.260
You really expect me to compete
with that woman?

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.090
It's the surest and quickest way,
isn't it?

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.630
You have to hurry.
Se Ri is getting closer to that woman.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.370
I'm a nervous wreck just watching it.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.540
So you're saying you'll compete with her
for the CEO position?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.740
Is there any reason I shouldn't?

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.770
I'm going to expose exactly who this Lucia
you trust so much really is.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.610
