00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.680
Not long ago, the Anti-Narcotics Unit...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.599
discovered that someone...

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
was trafficking drugs by mail.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920
According to a tip-off,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.320
on June 2nd this year,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.480
following the address on the mail,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.000
a package containing about a kilo of cocaine...

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.280
was found...

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.280
in the defendant's home.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.000
The suspect, Wang Yue, who was arrested...

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.440
on the spot, is the defendant.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.040
The prosecution has decided...

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.319
to charge the defendant with drug trafficking...

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
and dealing.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.320
Were the drugs found in the defendant's home?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.520
Yes, Your Honor.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.800
It's clearly stated in the indictment.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.240
Defendant.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.840
How do you plead?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Your Honor,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.480
on behalf of my client,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840
I plead guilty.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.240
That can't be.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240
My son is an honest man.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.240
He wouldn't do drugs.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920
Your Honor.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.799
My client committed a crime...

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
because of his greed.

00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.079
But since this is his first offense,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.400
and he has a mild mental impairment,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.680
he made this foolish mistake.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.560
I hope the court shows mercy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Defendant.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.240
Are you sure you're pleading guilty?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360
Your Honor.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.120
The defendant has signed a written confession.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.440
Does that mean I can't...

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.040
hear the defendant's response in person?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600
Defendant.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
Do you know...

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.720
how much a kilo of cocaine...

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.880
is worth?

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
3...

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.600
3,000.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.880
At market price,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.000
a kilo of cocaine...

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
is worth 800,000 dollars.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520
Your Honor,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.920
as stated earlier,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.479
the defendant has signed...

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480
a written confession.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.520
I'd like to ask the witness...

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.920
to answer a question.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Officer Huang Zhao.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.120
Were the drugs presented...

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.080
as evidence found intact...

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.639
at the defendant's home?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.200
Yes, Your Honor.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640
All the drugs...

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.120
were found at the defendant's home.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.480
If these drugs...

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.720
were found intact at his home,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.600
why were the packages...

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.559
covered in dirt...

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.640
and weed?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920
Defendant.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.640
I'm going to ask you some questions.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.440
Think carefully before answering.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.280
Did you personally sign...

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.120
for the package that day?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.320
Was your address...

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.320
used by anyone else?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.520
When the police arrested you,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.000
were you at home...

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.560
or outside?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.200
They told me...

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400
It doesn't matter what they told you.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.760
In court,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.520
I only need to hear the truth.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.480
Only the truth...

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.160
can help you.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440
That's right.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440
Tell the truth.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.200
I didn't sign for it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
My cousin...

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.079
always sends packages...

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.320
to...to my house.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760
At...

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760
At that time, I was...

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
I was about...

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
to go to work.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
They...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120
They just...

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
They just barged in.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
They...

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120
They grabbed me.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120
I was at home.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320
I was at home!

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.320
Defendant.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320
I'll ask you again.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.960
Are you sure...

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.320
you want to plead guilty?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.920
I’m not a drug dealer! I’m not a drug dealer!

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
I didn’t traffic drugs!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.360
I didn’t traffic drugs! I didn't!

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.000
I didn't traffic drugs!

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.720
(Justice is Mine)

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.720
(Episode 1)

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
In my opinion,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.720
there are three major issues in dispute in this case.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
First,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
the package...

00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:51.200
wasn't received by the defendant himself.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480
Second,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
the drugs...

00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.560
weren't from the defendant's house.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.120
Otherwise, there wouldn't be...

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.080
so much grass and dirt on the packaging.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200
Third,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
the defendant...

00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:07.520
didn't know the value of the drugs.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.200
Furthermore, no large amount of money...

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.360
was found in his bank account.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.599
As for why the defendant admitted to something...

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.200
he didn't do himself...

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.480
It's obvious.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.839
Whether it's his IQ...

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840
or his educational background,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.480
he's below us.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.359
But he has the most precious characteristic trait,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.440
which is honesty.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.280
Your Honor.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560
I only indicted him...

00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:33.600
based on...

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760
the police's evidence...

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760
and his confession.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Your Honor.

00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.679
When I first got this case,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
I was instructed...

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.079
to help my client...

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.240
plead guilty and seek leniency.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.280
Given that the indictment...

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560
is inconsistent with the facts,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and based on...

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
reasonable doubt,

00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:51.400
the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200
I hereby declare...

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.800
the defendant, Wang Yue,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080
not guilty.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360
The defendant is hereby released in court.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.880
Thank you!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We're okay now.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It's okay.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's okay, son.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
It's all right now.

00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:11.880
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.040
Officer Huang.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560
It's all right now.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.840
What is it, Your Honor?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
How long have you been a cop?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920
13 years.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.200
When you go home,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760
think about the oath...

00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:28.959
you made on the day...

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.040
you graduated in your uniform.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.120
Don't lose sight of why you started...

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.680
just because it's been some time.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
Mr. Qin.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960
Luo Wen.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:04.160
That was ridiculous.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.080
Both the prosecution and defense were so irresponsible.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640
How do you think...

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.640
they got the signature for that confession?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480
What do you think?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.279
Isn't it obvious? It must be...

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.719
Remember, you're a lawyer.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720
Evidence is everything.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.400
I'm sorry, Judge Qin.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.559
You can't go back to your office for now.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.920
- This way. - What's going on?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360
Be careful. This way.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360
We found something suspicious...

00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:25.440
in your office.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920
We suspect it's a bomb.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.760
The bomb disposal team is on it.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.400
Thank you for your hard work.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.520
You're not surprised at all.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.280
As a judge,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.759
I've sentenced a lot of people to jail.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.840
I can only imagine how many people...

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.040
want me dead.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
Madam.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.960
It's fake.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320
It seems there's only one person...

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.920
who would dare to threaten you.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
Besides,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480
this isn't the first time.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.599
Han Kui Long, who is in the public eye,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.079
is about to go on trial...

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.040
for serious injury and attempted murder.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.600
Han Kui Long is the founder of Han Group.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
20 years ago,

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.679
he participated in the redevelopment of the Tiger Rock wooden-shed area.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.680
After that, he got his start...

00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:32.720
running real estate and gambling houses in that area.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.280
There were rumors that...

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280
Han Kui Long...

00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:36.440
controlled a crime syndicate...

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.479
and made illegal profits...

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.879
under the guise of legitimate gambling parlors.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.119
He also engaged in loan sharking,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.600
extortion, and drug trafficking.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.199
Han Kui Long was also suspected...

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.599
of orchestrating serious attacks...

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600
on government officials.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640
But in the end,

00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:50.800
he was acquitted for various reasons.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080
Today,

00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:53.599
he has been indicted...

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600
for criminal offenses once again.

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:56.999
The case is being presided over...

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
by Judge Qin Yu, who's known for his impartiality.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.520
Given that the foreign prosecutor...

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.879
and his wife, originally assigned...

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.519
to this case, were attacked and injured...

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.039
by an assassin the day after Han Kui Long's arrest,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.239
since the start...

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.319
of Han Kui Long's trial, Judge Qin...

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.200
has been under strict police protection.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.360
He only made a public appearance...

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.400
when the court was in session today.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.760
Reporting to Command Center,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.320
Qin Yu has safely exited the vehicle.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.119
Will Han Kui Long's case...

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.440
result in a conviction?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.519
Will the rule of law and order...

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.920
in Hokong be upheld?

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.400
Let's wait and see.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.320
The defendant, Han Kui Long,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.279
is hereby charged...

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.400
with aggravated assault...

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520
and attempted murder.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400
Court is in session.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.760
Even though there's no definite evidence,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.840
I suspect Han Kui Long did it.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.160
Think about it, Mr. Qin.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.800
You sentenced him to 12 years.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.280
He's a gang leader.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.160
He'll definitely get back at you.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.800
Forget Han Kui Long for now.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.360
He's straightforward.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.640
You can see right through him.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440
There are people...

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.719
you just can't read.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.960
You don't know if they're human or ghost.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.640
You either go along with them,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.800
or...

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.800
be foolishly used by them.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.640
You can't learn these things in class.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.720
It's not too late for you to regret it now.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.640
Why should I regret it?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.399
Achieving social justice...

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.840
is what a lawyer should do.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.160
Focus on driving.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800
Okay, thank you.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280
By the way, Mr. Qin,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.239
I found out who your competitor is...

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.640
for the presidency of the court.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.280
It's alright. I don't care.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.600
It's Judge Lu.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.000
He sure is cunning.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.839
One time, I went to a hearing...

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.639
and saw him cite a judicial error...

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640
to force the prosecutor to leave.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.920
He even dropped the charges against the defendant.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.919
Actually, I'm running for office...

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.519
because I don't want a culture...

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.720
of compromise to affect the rule of law.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.999
The presidency of the court...

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.120
requires a higher standard of character.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.560
I'm sure...

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560
no one can compare...

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.999
to the most impartial...

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.280
Judge Qin Yu.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.720
Drive safely.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280
Goodbye, Mr. Qin.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.280
Bye.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.040
Honey.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320
I found it.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.400
Yi Wei.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.239
Didn't you mention an inter-school basketball game today,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.360
and you're going to be the cheerleader?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I don't feel like going.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880
Are you hungry?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600
I'm not.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.600
You're an adult.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.200
And yet, your clothes are all over the place.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.720
How come there are bloodstains on the soles?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320
Are you hurt?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320
Where?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920
It's not my blood.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.240
Whose is it then?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.880
Tell me.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.240
What exactly happened?

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.640
I wanted to see Mom.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.480
When I saw you didn't drive to work this morning,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.320
I took your car out.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.360
You just got your license,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.440
and you're already driving?

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120
Didn't we agree...

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:23.400
that I'd help you get used to driving first?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.040
How could you...

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240
Hey.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640
Did you hit someone?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.240
Was that the victim's blood?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.920
I didn't see that motorcycle.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.400
I was in the slow lane in the far left.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.359
My attention was all on the right.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360
I didn't expect that motorcycle...

00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:42.760
to suddenly overtake me from the left.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.439
So you hit the motorcycle.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440
What happened then?

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.360
I got out of the car to take a look.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560
What happened after that?

00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:50.120
I was so scared, and then I had asthma.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.239
I'm asking you about the person you hit. How is he?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240
I don't know.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240
- Did he get up? - I don't know!

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.240
Did he die?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.280
He was still moving then.

00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:04.360
I don't know what happened after that.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.439
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.240
So you hit the motorcycle with your car.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.319
Then, you left him on the street.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.440
After that, you ran away.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.280
I'm taking you to turn yourself in.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400
You're an adult.

00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.919
You have to take responsibility for what you've done.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
- Come on. - No.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880
Don't call the police.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880
Okay.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040
Listen to me.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.440
If you turn yourself in now...

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.520
You have a provisional license.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.680
You also have asthma.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.719
Plus, what happened to your family recently...

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.080
You mean what happened to Mom?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.120
That's a good reason.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.639
Besides, you don't have a criminal record.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.120
The judge might go easy on you.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.679
If you wait for the police to arrest you,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.919
you won't even have this chance.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.160
Am I going to jail?

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.199
That depends on whether the person you hit is dead or alive.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.800
- Don't ask that... - Aren't you a judge?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.040
So what if I'm a judge?

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.760
Does that mean I can hit someone?

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.400
You've committed a hit-and-run.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960
Let's turn ourselves in.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.120
Remember.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.640
Don't say too much later.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.280
But you have to tell the truth.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240
If they don't ask,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.520
don't go into detail.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
Just say...

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.920
you had an asthma attack...

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.120
when you were driving.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.800
You were scared and nervous.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360
You couldn't breathe.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.360
That's how the accident happened.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.680
I'll figure out...

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240
what to do next.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.480
How long will I be in jail?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.600
Let's not talk about that for now, okay?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120
Don't be afraid, son.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.080
Legally speaking, you're at fault,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840
but there are extenuating circumstances.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.040
I'll go in and talk to them first.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880
Wait for me in the car.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960
Calm down.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.040
Don't be afraid.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.840
Judge Qin, are you here to see Inspector Tang again?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
Yes.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.120
She's on the second floor.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.880
Madam, we have a serious case.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880
What is it?

00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:28.959
The hit-and-run case at noon.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.240
The motorcyclist has been identified.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.840
It's Han Kui Long's eldest son, Han Gang.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280
He's under emergency treatment.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280
We don't know if he'll live.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.280
Keep this under wraps right away.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440
Don't let the media know...

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440
the injured person is Han Gang.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440
Drag it out as long as you can.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.440
Also,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440
get someone to keep an eye on Han Kui Long.

00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:41.880
Someone will tip him off soon.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240
Yes, Madam.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600
Hello?

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600
Yi Wei.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.159
Drive away from the station now.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160
Wait for me nearby.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.240
Try not to be seen.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160
Judge Qin.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.640
Are you here to see me?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.640
I'll call you later.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680
Hello? Hello?

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.360
It's Yi Wei.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.760
I was going to pick him up.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.959
But when I came out of the house,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
I found...

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.360
my car missing.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.000
Your car is gone?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.160
Was it stolen?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.960
Actually, if you're busy,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.200
it's not a big deal.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.840
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.560
Something did happen,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.960
but we're handling it.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680
But for you, a judge,

00:22:46.681 --> 00:22:48.160
to have your car stolen...

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.640
Did something happen?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.960
I think it's probably...

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.600
just a car theft.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080
It's not that complicated.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.479
As long as it concerns you, Judge Qin,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480
no matter how big or small,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.720
I'll personally take care of it.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520
Let's go to my office.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920
Come on.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.680
You can't park here.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240
It's reserved for police cars.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.320
I just got my license.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.560
Give me some time.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.360
Why didn't you put up the learner's permit sign?

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.920
Did you drive here yourself?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480
My dad drove it.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.560
He's inside.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.680
Under what circumstances did you notice your car was stolen today?

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880
Around...

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.520
10am when I left the house,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.240
the car was still there.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.799
But when I came back in the afternoon,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800
the car was gone.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.760
Why didn't you drive to work today?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.199
Because I noticed...

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.360
my vehicle inspection had expired.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.040
So I didn't drive it.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.719
Zhou Luo Wen...

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.999
gave me a ride home.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
She's...

00:24:30.001 --> 00:24:31.159
the one...

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
beside me...

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160
in court.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.680
It's her,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
the one who suspected there was a bomb.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.999
There were a few big cases today.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.280
It's making me dizzy.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.560
Really?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
What's going on?

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360
Hey, get out of the way.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.200
Get down first. I'll move your car for you.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.040
Remember to tell your dad,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.999
new drivers must display the learner's sign.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.359
Otherwise, you can't drive alone.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360
Understand?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.639
It's a hit-and-run traffic accident.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.960
The culprit fled the scene after the crash.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520
Is it serious?

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.080
The one hit by the car...

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.800
is Han Kui Long's son, Han Gang.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.320
Han Kui Long's son, Han Gang?

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.960
Ever since Han Kui Long went to prison,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.600
Qi Chang Rong of the Old City Gang has been stirring up trouble.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.559
But he didn't expect...

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.199
Han Kui Long's son, Han Gang,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200
to be more ruthless than Han Kui Long.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.320
That's why he didn't get anything out of it.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.039
This time,

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.120
Han Gang was the one who got hit.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.880
It’s clear to everyone...

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.480
who’s most motivated behind this.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.480
If the two gangs really fight,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.640
who knows how many people will die?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.959
The injured man...

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.160
How serious is his condition?

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.360
Judge Qin.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.919
Perhaps this case...

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.160
will be handed over to you sooner or later.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.560
You'll find out in the future.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Okay.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.039
Didn't I tell you to leave the police station?

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040
Why are you still here?

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.200
The engine suddenly stalled.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160
And the police said...

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160
I blocked the car in front of me.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.800
Since the engine wouldn't start,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.760
he parked my car here.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440
Also,

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.920
he said I didn’t put on the learner driver sign,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.080
so he wrote down the license plate number.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680
Who was it?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.960
The guy who just passed you.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840
Zhuang Sen.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840
Help me check my car.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.480
It's acting up.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080
I don't know if it's because...

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080
I crashed it yesterday.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.640
Can you start it?

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.720
When did it stop working?

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400
It's not responding.

00:27:13.401 --> 00:27:14.520
It has nothing to do with the tires.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.320
Did you open the hood to check?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.800
I did.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.880
Weren't we going to turn me in?

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.520
There's no point turning you in now.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.240
The person you hit...

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800
is Han Kui Long's eldest son, Han Gang.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.400
Aggravated assault.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.200
Attempted murder.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.600
I sentenced Han Kui Long to 12 years in prison.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.199
If he finds out...

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.480
that you hit his son,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.400
once you're in,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.200
you'll never get out.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.800
Or, he'll use you to torment me.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.480
(Hokong Maximum Security Prison)

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.080
Mr. Long.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920
What is it?

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.280
I have bad news.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.280
Tell me.

00:28:23.281 --> 00:28:25.160
Your eldest son, Han Gang, was just hit by a car.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.560
He's in the hospital now.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.200
Is he alive or dead?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520
He's in critical condition.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.040
We've got him the best doctor.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.800
I'm asking you if he is alive.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.760
We won't know until he's out of surgery.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080
Who did it?

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.360
We don't know yet.

00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:38.480
The perpetrator fled the scene.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.320
I want to see my son.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640
Mr. Long.

00:28:42.641 --> 00:28:43.960
I'm afraid that'll be hard to do.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.720
The process is going to take...

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.600
I must see my son.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.640
I want to see him, dead or alive.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.200
You can't make the call, right?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.640
Get someone who can.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.240
Go!

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.679
This morning,

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.800
around 10am,

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480
you took the bus...

00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:14.640
to school as usual.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.759
But you suddenly realized...

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.880
you were having an asthma attack.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960
So,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.600
you got off at the bus stop at the park.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.239
You rested for a while,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240
but you didn't get better.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.639
So, you didn't go to school.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640
You went home.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.760
When you got home,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.480
it was around 12pm.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.840
However, the car was gone.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.719
You thought I took it,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
so you didn't bother.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160
Actually,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.240
it's because...

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I didn't get my car inspected.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.720
I called a court car to pick me up.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.000
When I came back in the afternoon,

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.800
I realized the car was gone.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.680
Remember everything I said.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.160
You can do it.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.720
After I leave later,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.599
don't contact anyone.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600
Are we clear?

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800
Who is it?

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.800
Wei, it's me, Qin Yu.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.680
I didn't expect to see you.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120
Here's the thing.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.999
I recently sold a batch of smuggled cigarettes.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.120
Turns out they were soaked in water.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.360
I've already paid for it.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.640
I'm afraid they'll come after me,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.000
so I'm protecting myself.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040
You wanted to see me?

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640
Yes.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.440
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.920
I wonder if you can...

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.640
get rid of my car as soon as possible.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.080
Get rid of it as soon as possible?

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.360
Is it what I think it is?

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.040
Ever since I sentenced Han Kui Long,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
I've been in trouble.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360
Whose car is it?

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.640
There are some things I can't handle myself,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.160
that's why I'm asking for your help.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.480
Can you do it?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320
Alright.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.640
I'll take care of it for you.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.920
Okay.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880
Hello.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.280
Judge Qin wants to talk to me.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440
It's alright.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.760
Come on in and talk.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.960
Qi Chang Rong's men are everywhere.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560
They're an eyesore.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Have you eaten?

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.040
Tell Bao to come see me.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.680
I need his help with something.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.560
Wei always talks about...

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.520
his elementary school classmate who became a judge.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Back then,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.519
Wei was framed...

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.760
while he was in the police force.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.480
Luckily, Judge Qin,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.360
you stood up for him...

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.840
and cleared his name.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720
I'm really grateful...

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.680
that you saved him.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.560
Actually, what happened with that case back then...

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.640
was only due to insufficient evidence.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.520
I've said it before.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.400
He didn't help me because we were classmates.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.160
He just didn't want...

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.560
to tarnish his reputation...

00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:44.160
as the judge who never judges unfairly.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.280
Don't say that.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.439
Wei was eventually dismissed...

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.720
from the police force,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.440
and both the underworld and legitimate businesses...

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.680
were targeting him,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.880
making it hard for him to even make a living.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.680
No matter what,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.080
I'm grateful that our family...

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.640
can be together.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.080
It's important for a family...

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.040
to be together.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.640
Mom, it's time for bed.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040
Okay, okay.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
Let's go to bed.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760
Alright then.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760
You two take your time.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Come on.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080
Up we go.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.120
- Time for bed. - Sleep early.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.920
Bao is here.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.400
The car keys?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440
Okay.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.280
Uncle.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.360
Did your mom nag you?

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.600
Do you have enough money?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.320
My younger siblings have to pay for their tuition.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.960
And the fourth one needs milk.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.920
There's never enough money.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.920
Take this.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.440
It's okay.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440
I can earn it myself.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.640
I've reminded you many times.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.800
Don't hang out with Qi Chang Rong's men.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.040
It doesn't matter who I hang out with,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200
as long as I make money.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.080
One mistake could ruin your life.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.000
If you want to make money, come to me.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.840
At least I'll have your back.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200
What is it?

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080
Help me dismantle the car.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.160
Consider this to be how you made this money.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.520
That's it?

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720
That's easy.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Where's the car key?

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.880
For someone to want to dismantle their car,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.640
it means they don't want trouble,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.520
and they don't want anyone to know.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.920
Sure.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.280
Whatever you say, Uncle.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840
Can you do it?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.880
Hey.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880
Can you do it or not?

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.600
It's open.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.960
You've been busy all day. Eat something.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080
Does Dad know?

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.760
Luo Qiang informed Mr. Long.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.520
Eat something even if you have no appetite.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.840
Dad is in jail.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.040
Han Gang is in charge of the family business.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.920
And now, this happened.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.120
Dad must be stressed out.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.040
If I were the one who got in the accident,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.320
that'd make things easier.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.240
What are you talking about?

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.200
You're both Mr. Long's sons.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.960
He wouldn't want anything to happen to either of you.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920
Ms. Lin.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320
Young Master Lie.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680
How is Young Master Gang?

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160
He had surgery.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.960
However, it's not looking good.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480
What did Dad say?

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600
Mr. Long said...

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.080
we must find the culprit...

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.880
even if it means turning Hokong upside down.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320
As of now,

00:38:49.321 --> 00:38:50.800
the victim's identity is still unknown.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.159
The police have refused to disclose...

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.360
any further information.

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.480
They only stated that...

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.480
the case is still under investigation.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600
We will cover any updates...

00:38:56.601 --> 00:38:58.280
in the evening news.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.320
Yi Wei.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280
Dad.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840
I was waiting for you to come back.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280
Don't worry.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640
I took care of everything.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.560
Dad, I don't want to drag you into this.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.160
I...will bear the consequences.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240
Go to sleep.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.240
Everything will be fine after you wake up tomorrow.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.520
This is the place.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320
Don't move.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240
I'll take care of this.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160
Don't move.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.680
Sit tight. Get down.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600
Madam.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.400
Hello?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400
Good morning, Judge Qin.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.400
I didn't wake you, did I?

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.720
It's okay. Please speak.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240
Your car...

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.240
has been found.
