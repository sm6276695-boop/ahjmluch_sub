00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.780
=Lust and Lies=

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:07.640
Step aside.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.040
I can let you take her,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.239
but you have

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.959
to cooperate with me.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.100
=Episode 21=

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.190
This is a surprising turn of events.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.400
It used to be

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.359
just Feifei and me meeting here.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.480
But today,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.840
it's the two of us.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.439
She doesn't need to come to you anymore.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.640
She's already told me everything between you two.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.079
You're old news.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.159
So, tell me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
How do you want to cooperate?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.199
Even though
you exposed Huo Beishan's crimes,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.240
he still commands
100,000 Huo Army soldiers.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.080
Your chances of winning

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.960
aren't great.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.919
I know.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.780
You've already bribed
a good portion of the Huo Army.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.280
I can send my troops to back you up.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.680
What do you want in return?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240
I want

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.520
the Huo family to fall.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.240
I want the Sheng family to gain

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.800
military power too.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.919
With me on your side,

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.680
your odds will improve a lot.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.240
This benefits both

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.479
you and me.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.000
Deal.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.159
Well then, here's to a successful partnership.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.520
These belong to Feifei, right?

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.400
I'll take care of them for her.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.120
Young Marshal Huo,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.199
you shouldn't help yourself
to things that aren't yours.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.879
Who are you to keep her things?

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.639
Where did all this come from?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.439
These belong to you, right?

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.439
They were at Sheng Weilian's place.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.639
These should be Liu Yiyi's.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.080
They often met there in secret.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.800
When I was a child,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.800
I played with knives.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.879
I never played with dolls.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.839
We've grown up surrounded by hatred.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.680
Marry me once all of this

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.879
is over.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.680
We'll leave Sucheng to start a new life.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.560
We'll buy a small house together.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.319
Work at sunrise, rest at sunset.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.680
Three simple meals a day,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.759
plain and humble.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.800
Living the simplest life.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.399
Then, we'll have children

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.319
and grow old together.

Huo Xiu…

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.040
Amitabha…

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.560
Amitabha…

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.199
Amitabha…

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.240
Amitabha…

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.120
Madam,

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.480
Miss Qingwan sent me.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
Tell her

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.199
not to worry about me

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.959
and to take care of herself.

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.120
Madam, the Huo family is beyond saving.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.000
I know.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.600
I'm the lady of the Huo family.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.120
I will never

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.559
leave the Huo family.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.639
Since you've made up your mind,

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:54.799
once you step out that door,

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.000
there's no turning back.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:59.120
May this help ease your suffering.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.000
You're the only bloodline
your mother left behind.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.559
Having you around

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.399
feels like she's still here.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.799
But I still lost the gamble.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.799
In the end,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.879
I brought trouble upon myself.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.039
You kept me close,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.639
so you should've known
this day would come.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.039
Huo Xiu,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.120
I once considered

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:17.799
letting you take control
of the Huo Army.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.720
The Huo Army?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.279
This was once the Gu family.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.039
Your Huo Army used to be the Gu Army!

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.799
And one more thing.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:43.279
My family name is Gu,

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:46.279
not Huo.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.080
If I'd known this,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.360
I should have killed
all of you back then.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.960
That Ruan Feifei,

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.600
is she already dead?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.120
I won't give you
another chance to hurt her.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.240
Why didn't you leave?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.879
Get out of here!

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.639
Beishan…

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.399
Why didn't you leave?

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.679
We're husband and wife.

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:48.960
We share life and death.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.360
And to think, my whole life

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.879
I never once looked you in the eye…

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:08.480
Madam.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.159
Stay away.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:13.600
Can you promise me one thing?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.879
Name it.

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:20.840
Take care of Qingwan.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:23.879
Protect her

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.279
for the rest of your life.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.480
I will.
