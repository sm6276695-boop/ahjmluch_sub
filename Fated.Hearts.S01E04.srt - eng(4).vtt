[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.970
[Episode 4]

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.150
If we had taken Zhennan Pass,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.039
our next move
would've been to march into the city.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.840
The fact that Jinxiu was able to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.640
mobilize all forces

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.400
instantly

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.509
proves that the city

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.509
was already heavily fortified.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.509
If we had entered,

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.120
they only needed to close the gates,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.000
and our entire army

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.800
would've been
slaughtered with no burial ground.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.680
According to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.410
your theory,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.560
Fu Yixiao's arrow

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.310
wasn't a disaster at all,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.350
but actually saved us?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.660
Otherwise, as someone
who has rendered meritorious service,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.630
why would her own people

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.710
want to kill her?

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.760
The fact that Jinxiu knew

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.900
our retreat route

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.840
can only mean

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.870
someone in Susha
is collaborating with the enemy.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.800
Someone has leaked

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.060
our military secrets.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.310
The person who wanted to kill Fu Yixiao

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.070
is most likely

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.960
the traitor
who's collaborating with the enemy.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.280
That's not necessarily true,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.610
but it's a possibility.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.800
The motive for killing Fu Yixiao

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.520
may well be that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.750
she had uncovered some secret.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.630
So Fu Yixiao

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.590
had uncovered some secret,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.960
and someone wanted to silence her?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.750
Anyway, this matter

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.690
concerns us.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.630
As long as we find out

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.630
who wants to kill Fu Yixiao,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.860
we can follow the clues

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.730
to uncover the traitor in Susha.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.390
Oh, come on!

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.470
Do we even need to investigate?

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.000
It's most likely

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.470
that old scoundrel Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.430
Do you have any evidence?

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.030
I... I'm not afraid of him...

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.050
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.079
I got so into thinking of
this place as a military camp

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.150
that I forgot about you
while we were talking.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.840
Your Highness.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.460
What should we do next?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.860
The people who have been following us

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.150
must have reached Yujing by now.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.040
We were being followed?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.820
How did I not know that?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.630
Your Highness, are you referring to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.560
those injured soldiers from Jinxiu

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.280
whom we saw

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.970
when we left Zhengnian Villa?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.000
Treat guests with hospitality.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.260
Take good care of them.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.420
Your Highness.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.840
Physician Xu, what are your chances

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.640
of curing her?

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.840
The lady's meridians are damaged.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.980
A full recovery

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.780
will be extremely difficult.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.030
I have less than

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.430
a 30% chance of success.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.960
What if we add this?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.060
Your Highness.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.430
This is really good for external injuries

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.800
and might do wonders

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.260
for your arrow wound.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.680
But for the lady's

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.930
damaged meridians,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.470
it won't be of much help.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.560
Besides, this belongs to
the Second Prince...

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.680
My brother gave it to me,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.590
so it's mine.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.430
What's mine is hers.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.640
Give her the best medicine we have.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.150
In short,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.000
you must heal my beloved concubine's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.120
hand injury.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.070
Yes.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.160
My dear.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.370
My dear. Don't be angry.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.730
Though you're called a concubine,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.860
you are the only woman

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.100
in my household.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.300
Why would I be angry?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.430
I'm so happy.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.780
However,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.050
if you give all your medicine to me,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.750
what will you do for yourself?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.270
Your arrow wound

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.940
hasn't healed yet, has it?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.650
Let me check it for you.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.790
Then I shall

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.920
also take a good look at

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.230
your hand injury.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.950
How's that?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.860
You two, escort Physician Xu out.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.620
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.770
Thank you, Physician Xu.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.350
Don't look at me.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.430
I know nothing.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.950
I didn't mishear, did I?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.630
Nah, you heard it right!

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.770
He said "beloved concubine".

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.510
You have to admit that

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.160
unmarried noble ladies

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.750
are too quiet and refined.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.710
They certainly can't match
this female general from the enemy state

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.440
in terms of vigor and vitality.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.330
His Highness has such tastes.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.160
How do you know so much about

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.690
His Highness's preferences?

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.700
You don't know?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.570
How would I know?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.360
Do you remember His Highness asked me

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.960
to find someone
to paint Fu Yixiao's portrait?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.000
That portrait was painted by me

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.950
based on His Highness's descriptions.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.800
Think about it.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.390
Who would describe their enemy

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.240
in such detail,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.070
vivid

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.690
and heroically impressive?

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.880
There were signs all along.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.080
We just realized it too late.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.470
But it does

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.870
seem to make sense.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.560
What cooperation?

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.990
You're clearly humiliating me!

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.630
I don't have time for that.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.230
Giving you the title of concubine

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.460
is to protect you.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.600
I don't have many women in my mansion.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.510
Your sudden appearance

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.240
will surely arouse suspicion.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.930
I don't need your protection.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.480
I sincerely cooperate with you,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.800
so you'd better play along.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.430
I also sincerely cooperate
with the First Prince,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.310
but I won't play along with you.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.540
Your Highness.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.600
Come in.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.570
As a member of my household,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.600
those clothes simply won't do.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.480
Take good care of my wife.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.560
Yes.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.000
My lady,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.390
let me help you change your clothes.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.930
Get out.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.320
I don't need to change.

My lady.

I am here to serve you by order.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.930
I don't need your service.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.370
If we leave like this,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.640
we'll be punished.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.310
Get out!

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.590
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.630
My lady,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.000
please change your clothes,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.970
or we'll have to kneel until you do.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.360
My lady,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.230
please change your clothes.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.560
Fine.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.270
Hurry up.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.360
I'll do it myself.
Don't remove my leg wraps.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.240
Who wears leg wraps

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.390
under their clothes?

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.990
My lady,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.310
let me serve you.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.460
I'll do it myself.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.400
Don't move!

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.040
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.750

are you satisfied now?

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.130
to show me off to others,

Western ginseng.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.460
Your Highness,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.510
Physician Xu is being too demanding.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.390
What kind of illness is it?

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.200
These are so...

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.910
so precious.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.600
Do we really need

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.030
all these expensive herbs?

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.320
There are many herbs on this prescription

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.250
that you can't buy even with money.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
I was thinking of using

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.160
some ordinary herbs.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.630
But I

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.360
still hope your arrow wound

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.160
can heal as quickly as possible.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.360
Since we've already agreed to cooperate,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.390
stop being so hostile toward me.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.080
I'm looking out for you in every way.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.010
Shouldn't you cooperate a little?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.150
Thank you for your consideration.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.250
Look at me now.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.200
Isn't this cooperative enough?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.750
I want to see

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.390
what tricks you're playing.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.030
Let's go.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.810
Help my wife into the carriage.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.870
Yes.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.170
[Wutong Mansion]

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.360
[Wutong Mansion]

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.470
[The Yujing City Streets, Susha Kingdom]

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.910
Killer God! Killer God!

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.510
Your Highness.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.570
So handsome.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.750
Your Highness.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.510
Who is she?

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.360
The woman from Jinxiu.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.150
Yes.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.510
So beautiful.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.510
Killer God of Susha.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.750
How could this woman
from Jinxiu possibly be worthy of

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.000
our prince?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.670
Who is that woman?

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.510
I heard she was picked up by our prince

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.320
from Jinxiu

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.150
and taken as his concubine.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.850
How could she
be the concubine of our prince?

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.150
A woman from Jinxiu

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.510
even dressed in gold and silver

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.110
can't display any nobility.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.200
Amazing.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.380
Look at her.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.670
With such crude behavior,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.630
how could she be a royal consort?

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.000
How inappropriate!

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.290
She truly doesn't deserve our prince.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.530
I knew you wouldn't stay put.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.440
You're parading me through the streets

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.440
just to make it known
throughout the city, aren't you?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.480
Your identity

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.590
will arouse many people's curiosity.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.440
Instead of making them

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.860
rack their brains guessing,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.150
it's better to just let them
see for themselves.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.850
Though my concubine

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.920
is no peerless beauty,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.480
she's hardly an ordinary woman.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.790
Let me guess.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.960
You're making such a grand display

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.090
to let everyone know

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.650
that I, Fu Yixiao, am still alive, right?

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.240
You're overthinking, my dear.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.690
I just wanted to show you

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.390
the beautiful sights of Yujing City,
that's all.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.920
If you don't tell the truth,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.870
today we'll have

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.000
a scene of a wife killing her husband.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.010
Since you've already guessed it,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.050
why bother asking?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.600
You're exposing me

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.840
in public

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.320
just to use me as bait.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.550
Don't you want to know

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.610
who's been following us all this way?

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.390
My Lady,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.260
we've arrived at Yujing City.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.630
Ignorant.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.870
My Lady,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.320
the road ahead is blocked.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.850
I don't know what happened.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.280
Anyone bold enough
to collide with the prince's carriage

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.790
is no pushover.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.950
Your Highness.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.350
Long time no see.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.000
I thought you were dead outside.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.640
You're still alive.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.470
How could I possibly die?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.840
Right.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.220
The wicked live long.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.240
How could you

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.720
die so easily?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.790
Look!

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.370
Another handsome man came.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.510
He's the only son of Marquis Murong,

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.360
Murong Yao.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.160
It turned out to be

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.870
[Murong Yao, the Heir of Marquis Changle]

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.870
that dashing young Marquis Murong.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.670
He's truly elegant and refined.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.590
Yes.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.730
Another one coming to bother you.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.730
They're much of a muchness.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.550
Miss, you're a rare beauty,

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.550
captivating at first sight.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.200
May I ask your name?

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.380
I feel like we've met before.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.800
Now I remember.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.870
It was that night,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.440
definitely that night.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.390
You must be the woman

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.270
from my dreams.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.080
Do you know who she is?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.390
I don't care.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.720
When I set my sights on a woman,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.600
no one...

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.670
She is my

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.440
newly taken concubine.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.510
What?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.670
Your concubine?

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.080
You're lying...

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.240
She doesn't look like a woman from Yujing.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.120
In this Yujing City,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120
I should have seen

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.520
all the beautiful women.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.440
Don't tell me you picked her up

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.840
somewhere along the way?

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.390
Enough, Yao.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.630
Enough? What enough?

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.630
I'm still angry!

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.840
You didn't even tell me you were back.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.080
I heard from others

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.510
that you were badly wounded at Pingling.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.080
I came here to

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.280
end our brotherhood.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.670
I no longer consider you my brother.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.030
You've been saying that

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.360
since we were children.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.630
Didn't you want to end our brotherhood?

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:01.890
Get off my carriage.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.360
What?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.880
Am I not allowed
to ride in your carriage anymore?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.000
Where are you going?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.440
To your mansion.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.849
I must say, you're really something!

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.109
Where did you get this?

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.550
Marquis Changle is our prince's

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.670
childhood friend,

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.290
as close as real brothers.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.200
Keep me in mind
when there's something good!

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.880
Right?

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.920
Excuse me.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.900
Excuse me.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.890
Excuse me.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.069
Excuse me.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.589
Excuse me.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.070
I heard they are close.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.590
Excuse me.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.750
We're friends.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.070
The three or four women around me

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.700
are not as good as her.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.640
Yixiao.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.350
Master.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.500
-Master.
-Master.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.470
Miss Yixiao.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.160
Master.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.780
Young Master Ling.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.510
What are you doing here?

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.160
Master!

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.510
I've brought them here.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.550
Master.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:54.890
I came to Yujing...

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.440
to get herbs.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.920
Master.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.680
Master, I'm Fang.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.350
-Master.
-Master, what's wrong?

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.160
What's wrong?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.000
Master.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.480
Master, what's wrong?

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.390
Who are you?

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.240
-Master.
-Master.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.790
I'm Fang.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.890
Oh no,

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.310
I completely forgot

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.960
about her memory loss.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.830
Master.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.200
Master.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.000
Get up.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.310
Get up.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.280
Master.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.000
I'm Fang.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.550
Who are you all, anyway?

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:34.920
Master.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.400
Master, we've all been good.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.880
Please don't abandon us.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.640
I'll be good.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.370
Master.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.790
Kids.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.640
You must be tired from your journey.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.240
Why don't we all
go to my mansion and talk there?

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.290
Let's go.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.310
Master.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.020
What do you think, Young Master Ling?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.490
Master.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.550
Master.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.240
Master!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.830
Okay.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.720
Master.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.400
Let's go.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.030
Master.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.600
-Master.
-Master.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.590
Master.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.860
Well...

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:33.790
My Lady.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.210
Stop crying, okay?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.920
Your master is just injured

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.330
and has lost some memories.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.980
She hasn't forgotten you.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.290
It's just that she can't

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.490
recall you right now.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.780
Do you understand?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.340
Don't cry.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.530
You say I'm your master.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.890
Do you have any proof?

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.160
No.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.950
Then that's just your one-sided story.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.790
How come I don't remember

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.190
taking on any disciples?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.360
Master.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.590
Master.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.640
Alright, stop crying.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.590
Something's wrong with Master.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.090
These children,

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.480
would they lie?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.880
Master.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.420
Master.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:33.960
When you go out,

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.480
we always wait at home

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.800
for your return.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.160
Ask Nine.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.030
You would ask Ning Fei

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.690
to send someone to take care of us.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.920
If you don't believe me,

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.510
you can ask Ning Fei.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.440
I don't know this

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.750
Ning Fei you're talking about,

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.440
nor do I understand

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.000
what you're saying.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.570
Master,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.960
don't you even remember

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.510
Ning Fei anymore?

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.820
You kids,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.960
go back to wherever you came from.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.920
Young Master Ling,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.960
please do me a favor

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.490
and send them away quickly.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.660
Where do you want to send them?

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.480
Is my grand prince's mansion

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.880
not big enough for a few kids?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.090
Don't be afraid.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.900
She doesn't want you, but I do.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.510
I'm not

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.880
as cold-hearted as her.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.440
I'd never disown my own disciples.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.880
I won't let you
talk about my master like that.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.510
Say that again if you dare.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.400
I won't allow it either.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.720
That fierce look on your faces

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.480
is quite similar to your master's.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.030
You're wasting your time

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.590
trying to intimidate me here.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.850
You should eat something first instead.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.640
Master.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.000
Master, wait for me.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.440
The food is here.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.350
Let me

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.880
introduce each dish to you.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.960
Crab-stuffed orange from Zhenxiu Pavilion.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.790
Crystal quail slices
from Zuixian Restaurant.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.480
Scallop soup and lychee paste

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.270
from Sai Jiangnan Restaurant.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.880
Each one is a signature dish

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.590
from the major restaurants in Yujing City.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.270
There's also my home-made

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.440
roasted whole lamb.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.200
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.410
Help yourselves.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.250
Don't be shy.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.880
Right, don't be shy.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.000
Make yourself at home.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.510
Eat.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.720
Master.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880
I can do it myself.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.130
Hurry up and eat.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.800
Then leave immediately.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.830
Don't just sit there. Let's eat.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.860
Make yourself at home.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.890
All of these are signature dishes.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.570
Young Marquis,

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.480
we have plenty of

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.940
wine cups in our mansion.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.550
Your shabby wine cups

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.300
are not worthy of my fine wine.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.080
Today we hold this feast

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.770
to celebrate Suige's return,

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.640
and also to wish Suige and Sister-in-law

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.200
a long and happy...

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.680
One more word of your nonsense,

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.280
and I'll cut out your tongue.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.540
What does she mean?

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.240
She's not my sister-in-law?

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.510
Miss Yixiao is such a beauty.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.380
How could she
possibly be interested in you?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480
Come on, Miss Yixiao.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.010
Let me raise my glass to you.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.680
Miss Yixiao doesn't care for wine?

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.510
With such spirit,

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.040
you're truly captivating.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.700
Since you're not his wife,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.920
Miss Yixiao, why don't you

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.720
stay at my mansion with the kids?

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.450
I'm a very open-minded person.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.550
I don't care where my friends are from.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.640
If you agree,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.400
my household will have

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.240
another dear sister.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.400
It's lively with more people,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400
unlike his place,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.310
which is so quiet

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.570
and full of smelly men.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.650
I actually like it.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.610
It's peaceful.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.790
What about you, miss?

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.840
Do you know who she is?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.400
She is from Zhengnian Villa,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.880
Lord Ling's daughter.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.350
My apologies.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.920
I've been terribly rude.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.650
So you're the renowned young physician.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.920
Please forgive my ignorance.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.780
You flatter me.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.160
I left in such a hurry last time

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.880
and didn't properly thank you.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.720
I owe it

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.160
to your Zhengnian Villa

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.460
that my injuries have healed so quickly.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.590
I'll drink first to show my respect.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.210
I'm full.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.570
I'll take my leave.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.810
-Master.
-Master.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.060
Your Highness,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.550
I must also excuse myself.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.440
I need to check

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.510
Miss Yixiao's hand injury.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.000
Very well, thank you.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.750
My lamb isn't even fully roasted yet,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.280
and you just let them leave?

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.720
She's so unromantic

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.760
and unyielding.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.620
All my efforts have been wasted.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.830
I'll eat it.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.640
Don't you remember

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.720
those kids?

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.400
When they came to Zhengnian Villa

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.330
looking for you,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.920
I could tell their concern for you

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.050
wasn't pretending.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.270
Are you suspecting that

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.270
someone deliberately arranged for them

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.330
to get close to you?

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.000
Aren't you overthinking this?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.400
Why are you here?

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.480
I felt sorry for the kids

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.720
walking all the way to find you,

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.270
so I wanted to give them a ride.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.420
I planned to take them back to the villa

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.310
and settle them in

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.830
once they couldn't find you

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.030
and gave up hope.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.400
I never imagined I'd encounter you

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.260
in Yujing City.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440
It all happened

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.170
so suddenly.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.830
Is that all?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:54.160
What?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.920
You don't believe me?

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.900
Fu Yixiao,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.790
you don't actually think

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.400
that Feng Suige and I

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.840
are working together, do you?

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.960
I went to all the trouble
of asking Mr. Qin

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.160
to find your whereabouts,

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.270
yet you actually suspect I'd harm you?

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.000
Anyway, those kids

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.270
have been delivered to you.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.600
Whether you accept them is your business.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.720
Why are you so afraid of Feng Suige?

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.640
That's none of your concern.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.550
During the meal just now,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.080
when he offered you a toast,

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.190
I could see the fear in your eyes.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.110
The rule that fighting is forbidden

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.030
at Zhengnian Villa,

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.430
you know about it, right?

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.840
Yes, I do.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:29.640
Since this rule

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.350
was established by the two royal families,

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.880
no one has ever violated it.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.180
He alone is the exception.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.880
I've never seen anyone

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.340
kill so many people.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.510
The entire room was soaked in blood.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.850
It took me

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.200
a full ten days to clean that floor

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.460
until it was spotless.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.170
He's not human;

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.070
he's a demon.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.330
I don't care what you think.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:09.050
I advise you to stay away from Feng Suige.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.390
I believe you.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.230
Fear cannot be faked.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.350
You're clearly terrified inside,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.210
yet you're still willing to stay.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:18.960
That's enough to prove

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.160
you're a good person.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.960
Yixiao.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.790
Miss Yixiao is actually a female general
from the enemy state?

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.790
Then you've got to be careful

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.790
staying by her side.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.240
Don't end up worse off than before,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.400
getting yourself hurt again.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.800
That's impossible.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.210
Then what are you after?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.790
She couldn't have secretly

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.750
surrendered to you, could she?

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.240
Tell me,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.910
how did you win her heart?

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.900
Stop prying.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.850
I'm just curious.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.400
Forget it if you won't tell me.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.720
I actually came today for another matter.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.050
I'm here to say goodbye.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.240
His Majesty has sent my father
to guard the North Pass,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.640
and I must accompany him.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.070
But as you know,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.880
I have no interest in court affairs,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.750
and I know nothing about
leading troops into battle.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.830
But I have no choice.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.230
I'm my father's only son.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.230
When will you return?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.590
What?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.120
Don't tell me

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.310
you'll miss me?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.790
Get lost quickly!

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.790
With you in Yujing City,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.310
I'm annoyed to death all day long.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.480
Annoyed?

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.830
Aren't you happy with me here?
Why are you annoyed?

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.490
All right, take this with you.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.080
You might need it out there.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.680
That day,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.750
when you went off to war,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.920
I was afraid you'd die out there.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.000
I specifically stole this

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.050
from my father.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.840
For that,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.190
I got a severe beating

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.310
and was confined for three months.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.200
Three months!

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.160
Is that all?

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.140
I never used it anyway.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.510
Why don't you take it back

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.400
and return it to your father?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.330
Can you really return clothes

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.510
after they've been given away?

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.240
I don't care.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.240
You, Feng Suige,

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.440
owe me a big favor.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.080
How do you want me to repay it?

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.930
I'll have to think about that,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.920
but whatever I ask for,

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.920
you can't refuse.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.070
Don't worry.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.720
I won't set my sights on

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.960
Miss Yixiao.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.400
I'm a man who values

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.260
brotherhood,

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.300
and would never

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.970
steal someone else's love.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.000
I'm leaving.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.400
You really don't want it?

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.310
No, I don't.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.400
Lu Ke,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.760
have they shown themselves?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:09.980
They were about to make a move

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.960
on Fu Yixiao at that moment.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.880
Young Marquis

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.040
came at just the right time.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.000
Once he showed up with his entourage,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.160
everyone scattered.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.110
But I had Gu Yu and Yun Fang

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.880
follow them.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.400
Good.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.000
My Lady talks about you every day.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.720
She came all the way here to see you.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.450
Why are you making her unhappy?

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.310
My Lady,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:34.070
why are you siding with an outsider?

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.530
Yixiao isn't an outsider.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.630
She's an ungrateful wretch.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.110
I told her to go get
the medicine box just now

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.240
and didn't call her for dinner.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.840
She's mad about it right now.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.270
With the smell of roasted lamb
filling the yard,

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.070
someone's stomach must be

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.600
growling from hunger, huh?

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.440
Not at all!

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.160
I'm not hungry at all.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.160
Does it hurt here?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.420
It hurts if I use force,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.720
but otherwise I don't feel much.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.160
From what I can see of your recovery,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.550
you should be fine day to day,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.590
but with this hand injury,
you can't engage in combat.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:05.310
If you want to regain your former skills

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.540
as a top archer,

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.440
I'm afraid it'll take some time.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.650
I'm not really sure

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:10.500
if I can fully heal

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.500
your hand injury.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.420
But I promise

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.830
I'll do my best.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.160
Thank you.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.220
I had them save a lamb leg for you.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.640
Really?

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.540
But it's so late now.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.280
Are you sure you still
want to eat roasted lamb?

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.690
I'll go eat then.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:37.480
There are only four.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.960
We've only identified four so far.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.790
They left the city when it got dark

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.250
and didn't stay in Yujing.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.900
They're cautious indeed.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:43.920
Your Highness,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.480
they're definitely not ordinary spies.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.550
As per your instructions,

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.510
Gu Yu and I followed them out of the city,

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.350
but didn't pursue further,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.440
afraid of alerting them.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.330
Who

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.510
do you think

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.440
they could be?

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.340
Judging by their methods,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.400
they must be Jinxiu secret guards.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.660
Jinxiu secret guards?

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.510
They serve under

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.000
Prince of Zhennan, Xia Jingshi.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.350
The one seeking to kill Fu Yixiao

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.050
is him?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.830
But if he

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.550
wanted to kill

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.810
a military commander,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.360
would he go to such lengths?

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.910
This gets more interesting.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.060
Your Highness,

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:11.730
what are

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.920
our next steps?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.960
The more anxious they are

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.220
to get rid of Fu Yixiao,

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.160
the more it shows that Fu Yixiao

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.110
holds a secret

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.590
that terrifies them.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.510
We'll stay put on the surface,

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.310
but deploy our forces secretly.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.350
They might only get one chance,

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.640
and we too

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.160
have only one.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.030
We must wipe them out completely.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.110
As Master taught,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.240
of ten parts of skill,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.350
seven come from stance training.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.150
We need to firm up our lower body.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.330
Not bad,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.810
you're practicing quite well.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.130
But just learning horse stance

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.490
won't be enough to protect your master.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.160
That's none of your business.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.240
Being cautious around strangers

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.060
is also good.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.180
But I'm your master's friend.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.550
I only want

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.960
to help you

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.690
because you're her disciples.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.440
If you don't appreciate it, so be it.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.740
You!

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.530
How do you want to help us?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.910
Follow me if you want to know.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.600
Don't go.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.640
I'll go see

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.440
what he can do.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.500
I'll be right back.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:52.790
Fang!

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240
-Fang!
-Brother.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.200
It is necessary to have effective tools

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200
to do good work.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:18.550
If you want to master a skill,

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.840
you must first choose a suitable weapon.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.440
Just like my master,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.550
she has an incredibly powerful

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.680
Moon-Shooting Bow.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.920
You know quite a bit.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.960
Of course.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.790
I've been with my master
since I was little.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.240
I know everything about her.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.790
Really?

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.510
I don't believe that.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.270
Why would I lie to you?

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.550
Shunzi, Nine

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.840
and I are all orphans.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:40.690
Our fathers and uncles

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.590
were the generals of our master.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.870
In the battle at Yazipo,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.000
they all sacrificed their lives.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.510
Later,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.980
our master adopted us.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.680
She taught us martial arts
and swordsmanship,

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.390
saying it was for self-protection.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.400
We want to join

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.000
the Zhennan Army when we grow up,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.400
but she doesn't approve,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.830
saying that the battlefield is dangerous.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.400
But she herself...

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.720
So Yixiao adopted

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.780
the children of her fallen comrades.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.280
You're trying to
get information out of me?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.920
Yes.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.550
I am indeed curious about

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:16.090
the connection
between you and your master.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.860
Come on.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.170
This is for you.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.030
Are you really giving this to me?

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.820
Of course.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.480
From today onwards,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.510
I am your friend.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.860
Your Highness,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.070
the marriage proposal letter
from Jinxiu has arrived.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.480
His Majesty summons you to the palace.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.540
Marriage proposal?

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.739
Who's marrying whom?

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.630
[Wutong Mansion]

00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:59.490
Your Highness.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.340
-Stop following me.
-Your Highness!

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.930
Your Highness!

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.400
Oh no!

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.340
This is trouble.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:13.690
We need to stop him.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.070
We can't let him enter the palace

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:14.880
like this to see the Emperor.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.760
Who can stop him?

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.320
Looking at him like this,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.360
I'd even believe he'd
burn down the imperial palace!

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.030
Gu Yu.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.780
Keep an eye on Fu Yixiao at the mansion.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.510
[Wutong Mansion]

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.270
What are you doing?

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.400
Assemble the Feng Battalion.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.150
Nonsense!

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.360
Do you want everyone to think

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.190
His Highness is staging a rebellion?

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.050
Are you insane?

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.110
His Highness said

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.020
no.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.980
Gu Yu.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.590
Gu Yu is right this time.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.320
Let's talk inside.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.960
Don't stop me.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.670
Don't stop me!

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.000
Give me back my dagger.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
You're a traitor!

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:42.110
You took his stuff,

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.230
and you're still holding onto it!

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.920
-Let go!
-You're wrongly accusing me.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.400
-He gave it to me.
-Give it to me.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.000
I didn't say anything to him.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.670
You're wrongly accusing me.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.440
Return my dagger!

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.280
Give it to me!

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.480
This the dagger he gave me.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.080
-Master.
-Are you alright? Get up.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.170
Master.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.400
Feng Suige gave this dagger

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.150
to me.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.640
She took it away.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.400
Master,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.420
he's a traitor.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.680
He just insists on having this dagger!

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.760
Qin!

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.430
Qin, are you alright?

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.730
Hang in there.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.000
Hang in there!

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.690
General.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:25.940
My...

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.030
My family

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:30.130
has no other members left.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.470
I have only one son,

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.400
who is at home in Pingling City.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.030
His name is...

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.710
-Fang.
-He's a traitor.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.760
I'm not a traitor.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.440
He gave me this dagger.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.780
-There's a birthmark on his arm.
-It's mine.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.070
Master, I was wrong.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.200
Look straight ahead.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.770
Stand properly.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.820
Throw a punch!

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.510
One.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.230
Two.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.480
Yixiao.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.280
Yixiao.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.880
Brother Ning Fei.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.710
Brother Weiran.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.300
Master!

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.670
-Master!
-Master!

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.930
-Master, don't scare me!
-Master!

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.720
Your Majesty.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.070
Now that the war between
our two nations has just ended,

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.480
there is deep hatred
between soldiers on both sides.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.960
Without a significant event

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.160
to pacify the people,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.550
if conflicts arise again at the border,

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.680
I fear both sides will suffer greatly.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.280
Moreover, the marriage alliance

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.630
was proposed by Jinxiu,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.360
which clearly shows

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.150
their eagerness for peace.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.050
If Jinxiu is so eager for peace,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.070
why don't they send their princess

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.400
to marry into our Susha?

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.930
Susha has only one princess, Xiyang,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.330
who is His Majesty's precious daughter.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.390
In my opinion,

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:28.210
we must never send
our princess to beg for peace.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.370
How is this begging for peace?

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.550
Jinxiu clearly proposed
the marriage alliance,

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.670
and they took the initiative
to propose it.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.330
The First Prince
requests an audience outside.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.990
Your Majesty.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.430
The First Prince requests an audience.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.710
Summon the First Prince.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.870
Your Majesty, this son pays his respects.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.280
Rise.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.070
The Emperor of Jinxiu has sent envoys

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.280
with a formal proposal
for a marriage alliance,

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.710
requesting that I marry
your sister Princess Xiyang

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.800
to the Prince of Zhennan,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.760
in exchange for lasting peace
between our nations

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.050
and time to recover.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.070
What do you think?

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.280
Your Majesty.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.590
My wounds have mostly healed,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.030
and the Feng Battalion
is ready for battle,

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.830
prepared to fight at any moment.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.720
Your Majesty.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.960
Susha has just endured a fierce battle.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.000
Our troops, provisions, and siege weapons

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.600
have been greatly depleted.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.180
If we go to war again now,

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.690
it will do nothing but harm
to both the state and the people.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.510
I believe

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.120
that gaining an opportunity for Susha

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.710
to recover and rebuild

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.040
is the best strategy.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.870
Moreover,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.070
if the princess truly brings peace

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.150
to the people of both nations,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.610
it will indeed be
a blessing for all mankind.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.230
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.360
How dare you!

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.770
What are you doing in court?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.880
Susha has never had

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.670
a precedent of sending
a princess for a marriage alliance.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:51.150
Peace has never been achieved

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.840
through humiliation.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.280
Only by fighting for

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.000
every inch of our territory

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.630
can we speak of true peace.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.240
Jinxiu's proposal for marriage

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.660
appears to seek peace,

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.170
but is actually an insult.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.590
Not all the men of Susha are dead yet.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.960
I will never use a woman

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.590
to exchange for your so-called

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.880
recovery.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.150
Enough!

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.230
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.960
Your desire to
defeat enemies and achieve merit

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:30.960
is commendable.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.150
But in Susha, no one

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.840
has ever dared

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.670
to shout in the imperial presence!

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.550
The civil and military officials
behind you,

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.610
are they not all loyal to the country?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.740
Even if there are disagreements,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.000
it's not your place to call for war.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.690
All of you, rise.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.510
Your Majesty.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.710
I think

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.800
the First Prince is right.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.130
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.150
Share your thoughts.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.550
A marriage alliance only
brings temporary peace.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.630
It can never resolve the
deep-seated enmity between our nations.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.030
This marriage proposal comes from Jinxiu.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.440
If we reject it,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.280
they will have reason
to wage war against us.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.960
The First Prince
is brave and skilled in battle,

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.030
so naturally he does not fear the enemy.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.590
But years of continuous warfare

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.360
have brought
unbearable suffering to our people.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.670
If we collect more provisions for war now,

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.230
I fear countless citizens

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:27.960
would have to give up

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.860
even their winter food supplies.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.400
I do have an idea.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.670
We can return the four cities

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.710
west of Zhennan Pass to Jinxiu.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.910
If Jinxiu reclaims these four cities,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.510
peace between our nations
can be assured for at least three years.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.760
What did you say?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.400
Your Highness.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.400
I am well aware that you shed blood

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.660
and fought hard to conquer these cities.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.590
But this is our only option.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.880
For our people,

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.590
and for the greater good,

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.450
Susha cannot endure another war.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.250
For the princess's sake,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.170
we cannot agree to
the marriage alliance either.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.590
Enough.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.960
Let me

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.920
think about it.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.150
Men fight for their country,

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.760
and women

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.330
can also share in
the burden for their nation.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.410
Inform the princess of this matter

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.070
and hear her opinion.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.760
Your Majesty.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.280
The court is adjourned.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.590
We respectfully send Your Majesty off.
