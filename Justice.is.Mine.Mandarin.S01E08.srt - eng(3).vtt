00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.800
Doctor!

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Did something happen?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.960
- Hey!
- Xiao Gang!

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320
Xiao Gang!

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320
What's going on?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.600
Xiao Gang is awake!

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.640
Xiao Gang!

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
Xiao Gang.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
Han Gang.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.800
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.840
(Episode 8)

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240
Who is it?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
It's me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What do you want?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.719
Bao was your nephew,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.040
and he was my good buddy.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.600
Doesn't that give us a reason
to have a good talk?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.760
Come in alone.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.920
Stand here and wait for me.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.160
Bao was still young.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.399
He didn't know
how evil the world was.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.480
That's why he got tricked.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.800
What are you trying to say?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.680
You don't want to talk about Bao?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.600
Then let's talk business.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
I have no business with you.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680
Wasn't the 200,000 HKD
you gave Bao's family...

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.920
a deal in exchange
for a person's life?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880
Wei.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.440
Sha Sha also knows
you're rotten to the core.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.879
Otherwise, why would she have
taken your child with her...

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.200
and left you?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.280
Sha Sha is a nice girl.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.879
She has admirers
everywhere she goes.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Shut up!

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.440
So many men wanted to marry her,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.280
but she chose you.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.000
Do you think she regrets it now?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960
I should talk to her sometime.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Don't you dare!

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.520
You gave Bao's mother 200,000 HKD...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.160
to make her son confess.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.640
But you caused Bao's death.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.159
However, you didn't dare
go to the police...

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.720
because they fired you.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.880
You hate the police.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.760
But I don't care.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.200
I can snitch.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.520
I can even get a reward.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.160
Sha Sha is from
the Old City District.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640
You married her.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
That makes you one of us.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.960
That means...

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.640
we take care of each other.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.280
No matter how dumb you are,
I'm sure you know what I mean.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.359
I'm going to give Han Kui Long
a big present.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.880
You'd better hurry.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.240
When I get anxious,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.040
I don't know what I'll do.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400
Han Gang.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.240
Han Gang.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720
Doctor.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.920
Can he hear us?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
He can hear us,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400
but right now,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.680
he might not understand.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600
Han Gang.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880
It's me, Xiao Lie.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.600
I'm glad you're okay.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.520
Dad has been worried about you too.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.600
Do you remember what happened?

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.920
You were on a motorcycle.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.400
Someone tried to hit you with a car.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880
Do you remember?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.000
Do you have something to say?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120
Han Gang.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.520
Answer me.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.160
Han Gang, you've been in a coma
for half a month.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.320
Calm down first.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760
He just woke up.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.880
It will take time for him
to fully recover.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520
Ms. Tang is right.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.079
We can't rush the patient.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.160
Let's give him some time.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
Let's take it slow.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640
I'm sorry.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760
I was too emotional.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.400
There's no doubting...

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.440
a parent's love for their child.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720
But this kind of love...

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.000
made the defendant
disregard the law.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.480
She encouraged her son...

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.240
to bully his classmate at school,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.600
resulting in an innocent casualty.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840
After the incident,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.176
not only did she want
to destroy the evidence,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.920
but she also wanted
to frame someone else...

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.800
to escape criminal charges.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.536
Even though she cooperated
with the investigation...

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.160
and offered compensation
to the victim's family,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.840
it still cannot compensate...

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.440
for the damage she has caused.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760
I believe...

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.720
the defendant's actions...

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.320
as a mother...

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.320
were understandable.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.760
But they are unforgivable.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.600
You must pay...

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160
for your actions.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720
The verdict...

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.840
is not just a punishment
for the defendant.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.240
It is to ensure...

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.040
that such a tragedy...

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
does not happen again.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680
The Court hereby finds...

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.239
the defendant, Huang Juan,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.480
guilty on all four counts.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.000
She is hereby sentenced
to five years in prison.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320
Han Gang has woken up.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
Aren't you happy?

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.080
He just woke up.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.960
He can't do any work yet.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.480
The doctor said...

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.280
that he will get better.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.840
It's just a matter of time.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.360
Time is the problem.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.240
Why do you think...

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.320
I let them
have their way this time...

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.080
and put myself in jail here?

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.120
That's because if I leave,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.039
everything I've built
over the decades...

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.360
will be gone.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
Even worse,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.360
that mad dog, Qi Chang Rong,
would benefit from it.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.520
If I agree to go to jail,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.639
someone can take credit for this.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.280
Someone will benefit from it.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.240
I'm...

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.960
riding in the same boat as they are.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.800
It was all a deal.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.680
A deal doesn't have to be fair.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
To win,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.480
it's not about how strong you are.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.520
It's about...

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.720
who has the fewest limits.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960
You're a wolf.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.720
But compared to your brother,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.680
you're not as cruel
and despicable as he is.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600
You two brothers...

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.200
can help each other.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.360
But when it comes
to doing bad things,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.080
let your brother handle it.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.160
As long as Han Gan gets better,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.440
I can do anything.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.560
Going after your brother...

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.400
means going after the Han family.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.800
You killed that car thief,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.040
which gave them an excuse...

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.960
for that mad dog to cause trouble.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.520
While your brother
is in the hospital,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.440
that mad dog
will definitely cause trouble.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.080
We must hold our ground,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.680
but we can't lose our strength.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Understood.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.720
Take good care of your brother.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
I got it.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760
Come and take a look.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760
- Gosh.
- Little kid.

00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:18.721
- Look how cute they are.
- Which one do you like?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880
Do you like this one?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880
Thank you.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
This is for you.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.200
Let's talk about Ma Shan Bao.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.160
That kid is so pitiful.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
He was only 18 years old.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.280
I've known his mom for a long time.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.840
I saw her this morning.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.360
She was crying her eyes out.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.160
Who did it?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.720
If I knew who did it,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.480
he would already be dead.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.200
He's from your Old City Gang.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600
Mine?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.280
I'm not a part of any gang.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.800
The entire Old City District
is like a family.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.839
I, Qi Chang Rong,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.240
love protecting children.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640
It's so cute.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.040
Xiao Jun.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560
Xiao Jun!

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
Mom!

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.399
Mom! Mommy!

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.400
Xiao Jun!

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.640
Xiao Jun!

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.320
Give me back my child!

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640
Don't go!

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800
Xiao Jun!

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.200
Don't go, Xiao Jun!

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.080
Do you have a child?

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.040
Madam is asking you a question.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.120
You're not the one
asking questions here.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.640
Where were you at 7am...

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.480
on the day of the incident?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440
I was at home,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.880
In bed with my girlfriend.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.440
Do you want me
to describe the details?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.360
Do you want me
to detain you for 48 hours?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.160
You know very well...

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.840
how many cases you're involved in.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.600
I can arrest you...

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840
based on any one of them.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.760
You should know...

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.320
who killed Bao.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.480
If I did, I wouldn't have
called you here.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.200
You arrested Bao...

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.360
because he hit Han Gang.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.119
Do you think
he'd let Bao off the hook?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120
Are you saying...

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.320
Ma Shan Bao hit Han Gang?

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800
Tang, don't pretend
to be ignorant in front of me.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.920
You police pretend to be righteous,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.016
but you've secretly committed
countless evil deeds.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040
You know who did this...

00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:38.320
better than I do!

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.120
You wench!

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
Don't cross the line!

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600
Qi Chang Rong.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
What?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.520
Are you arresting me now?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.120
If not,

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920
then I'm leaving.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.640
Madam told you to go.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480
Let's go.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Get up.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720
Let's go.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.840
Second Young Master Han.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.240
Is having an aunt not enough?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.240
You even came here
to find a godmother.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.000
Have you considered
your own mother's feelings?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.359
I'm really afraid she won't be able
to rest in peace...

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.560
in her coffin.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.280
If you're such a good son,

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
then go down there...

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.400
and be a good son to your mother.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.960
Be careful not to trip and fall.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.240
I won't let you...

00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:52.400
get away with this.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.160
Hey, Qi Chang Rong.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360
Don't make trouble.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.520
- Hello.
- Wei.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.760
They took Xiao Jun.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800
What did you say?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.400
It's Qi Chang Rong.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.160
I recognize his men's car.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.080
Sha Sha, don't be afraid.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.320
Go home, lock the door,
and watch our daughter.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.640
Our son will be fine.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840
I will bring him back.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320
Wei.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.160
Wait for me.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.960
Qi Chang Rong!

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.359
Come at me if you dare.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360
Leave my family alone.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.319
Wei, didn't I tell you?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.520
My patience is limited.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.800
And I hate coaxing children.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.440
If I have to keep doing it,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.680
I feel like slapping them
over and over again.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.199
I'll steal and rob anything for you.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.320
Just release my son first.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.880
Look at you.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.296
Who was the one who said
we had no business to discuss?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.680
We've just made a deal now.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.760
Madam will be right with you.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280
Do you have any paper?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280
Xiao Jun!

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.880
Xiao Jun!

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200
Xiao Jun.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920
It's okay.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920
Mommy is here.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.440
It's okay. Don't cry.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440
It's okay now.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600
It's okay now.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800
Don't cry.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.280
It's okay.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440
We haven't even started,

00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:14.241
and you're already writing
your own statement.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.560
I saw Qi Chang Rong leave.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240
What?

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.776
Is the detention center too full?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.840
Is there no room for him?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.920
If you give me some useful leads,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.960
I can get another room for him.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.456
Weren't you the ones who moved
the suspect who hit my brother...

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.960
to a different cell?

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.720
The suspect's name is Ma Shan Bao.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320
No.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.960
The term is different now.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.680
It should be Ma Shan Bao,
the gunshot victim.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.736
For the sake
of your brother, Han Gang,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.680
you had every reason
to kill Ma Shan Bao.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320
Madam.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.600
If you had any evidence,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.120
you wouldn't have just called me in
for questioning.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.496
You would've gone
to the Special Duties Unit...

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.680
in the middle of the night...

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920
and had them bring me in.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.680
We don't have to wait
for the middle of the night.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.120
If you want to go to jail so badly,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.960
I can send you in there anytime.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720
I'm warning you.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.640
Don't make things worse.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.040
You're not your brother or your dad.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.560
Don't embarrass yourself.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.440
I want all the bloody violence
to stop.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.240
That Ma Shan Bao...

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.760
Are you sure he's the one
who hit my brother?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.800
If it wasn't him,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.360
why would someone have killed him
for revenge?

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.920
If you police are so capable,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.840
last night,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.080
why did you let this man...

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.240
sneak into my brother's room
last night?

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.680
He works for Qi Chang Rong?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.480
No, he doesn't.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600
Are you sure?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.960
If he was from the Old City Gang,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.679
I'd be able to smell their stench...

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.840
from afar.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600
Coach.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600
Are you looking for me?

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560
Qin Yi Wei.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.440
I was planning to just leave.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.400
There's no need to say goodbye.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040
Your problems...

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.440
and your family's problems...

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.800
I really can't solve them.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.880
I don't want them
to become my problems too.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.240
You should get help from an expert.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520
I'm leaving.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.480
There's no need to say goodbye.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.200
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.400
No, don't talk.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.800
Close your eyes.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.320
Give me your hand, dear.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.600
I'm here.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.120
Come with me.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.840
Okay, you can sit down.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.240
Yes, don't open your eyes yet.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.120
You're so pretty.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920
Hold on.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.360
Soon,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.400
you can open your eyes.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320
Happy birthday.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.560
Happy birthday to you

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.520
Happy birthday to you

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.320
Happy birthday to Inspector Tang

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.280
Happy birthday to you

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.960
Come on, make a wish.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120
Blow out the candle.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160
Thank you.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440
Hello. What's up?

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.799
Okay, keep an eye on him for me.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800
I'll be right there.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400
What is it?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.680
You know I've been investigating
the Wooden Shed arson case.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.520
I suspect the one who died
in prison was a scapegoat.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.040
There must be another mastermind.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960
What's the situation now?

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.000
I know someone named Liu Mao.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.736
We used to play together
when we were kids.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760
Lin Qian said...

00:22:20.761 --> 00:22:24.000
that she once heard him brag
about meeting the real arsonist.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.240
After that,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.960
he left Hokong and disappeared.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.319
I just got a call from someone...

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.480
who saw him in Tuncheng.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.880
Then you should go to Tuncheng now.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.759
- Go.
- It's your birthday today.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.480
We can celebrate
my birthday anytime.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760
Hurry and go.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.679
But you have to wait for me...

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.880
to cut the cake.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320
Why?

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.240
Because if you cut it without me,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320
it will explode.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.280
Okay.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.560
I'm sorry.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.720
It's fine.

00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:54.800
- Go on.
- I'm sorry.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.480
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.999
This is the man...

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.840
who entered Han Gang's room.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440
Who is he?

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.960
Watch the next video.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.760
It's the same person.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.440
Han Lie is actually
pretty good at drawing.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.680
Who is he?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.120
He doesn't look like a gangster.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840
Of course, he's not.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.320
Do you know him?

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.880
Judge Qin, Inspector Tang is here.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400
Inspector Tang.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400
Can we talk?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.880
Have a seat.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.000
Aren't you investigating
Ma Shan Bao's case?

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.080
Do you have any leads?

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.120
The Special Investigation Division
is working on it.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440
I'm here this time...

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.800
to ask you about something else.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.600
How have you and your son been?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Are you still fighting?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640
We're fine now.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160
What's wrong?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.959
Two nights ago,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960
he went to the hospital.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.519
I didn't hear him say he was sick.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520
How do you know that?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.680
When I asked Han Lie
for a statement...

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.360
for Ma Shan Bao's case,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480
he told me...

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.120
that someone broke into
his brother's hospital room.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.480
So, I went to the hospital...

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.920
to check the security footage.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080
And...

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.800
I saw this.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.800
Just looking at this photo...

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
There's another one.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560
Judge Qin,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640
I want to know...

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.600
why your son went
into Han Gang's hospital room?

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.400
He was even wearing a doctor's gown.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.360
This photo looks a bit strange.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840
I'll go back and ask him.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.080
This is Han Gang's room.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.040
The car that hit Han Gang...

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.240
was your car.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.920
Then, your son...

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.520
wore a doctor's gown...

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.680
to go and see Han Gang.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.639
Do you really think...

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.160
there's no connection
between all this?

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.720
I don't dare
to answer that question.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.136
I'll go back and ask him first.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.160
Here's my advice.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.136
You should bring him
to the police station immediately.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.200
Let us do the questioning.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.816
Of course, you can be there too.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840
That's your right.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040
That's the best way...

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.080
to clear him of suspicion.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320
Suspicion of what?

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.120
You know what I'm investigating.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280
Okay.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.080
I'll make the arrangements.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.480
I'll let you know.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120
Okay.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.600
Yi Wei, where are you?

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.080
What is it?

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640
Is class over?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I'll pick you up.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.880
Dad.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040
Do you remember...

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.256
the ice cream shop
that used to be by the post office?

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.280
Yes.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.560
We used to go there every week.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.280
I remember...

00:27:19.281 --> 00:27:20.760
Mom loved lemon shaved ice.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.840
She said it's healthier
without milk or sugar.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.920
But I didn't like it.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
I have a sweet tooth.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.840
But I bought
lemon shaved ice just now.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.400
Was it good?

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480
It was terrible.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.320
I passed by there last week.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.640
That shop went out of business.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.160
Where are you now?

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.920
Why did you go to the hospital?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.000
Why did you go to Han Gang's
hospital room two days ago?

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.320
Someone saw you.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840
You've been discovered.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.440
I wanted them to see me!

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.399
I'm suffering.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.760
I can't take it anymore!

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:09.840
You haven't answered me.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.759
Why were you there?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.560
Mom was never like you.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.880
I'm not your prisoner.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.120
I don't want
to answer your questions.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.200
Are you looking for Tang Jia?

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.519
She got off work early today.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520
She just left.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600
Tang Jia.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.920
What is it?

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.120
Thank you for taking care
of my brother.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040
This is for you.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.240
It's okay. It's my job.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760
I said,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600
this is for you.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.400
Hey, it's okay.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480
It's really okay.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.360
Why did your son
go into Han Gang's hospital room?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.440
He was even wearing a doctor's gown.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.800
I don't dare
to answer that question.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.120
I'll go back and ask him first.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.736
You should bring him
to the police station immediately.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.800
Let us do the questioning.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920
That's the best way...

00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.720
to clear him of suspicion.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.240
Suspicion of what?

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.800
You're back.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.359
Why are you sitting here alone?

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.400
You didn't turn on the TV.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.560
I'm thinking about something.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.400
Thinking?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640
About what?

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.680
I'm thinking...

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.800
if what I'm thinking is true,

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.920
it'll be hard for me
to accept the truth.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.920
Okay.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.240
Let's not talk about work.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.800
By the way,
what's the plan for today?

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.280
I've arranged everything.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.360
First of all,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400
we'll go to the buffet...

00:30:48.401 --> 00:30:50.640
that I've been looking forward
to for a long time.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.000
After that, we'll go singing.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.759
It's my birthday.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.439
Yet, we're going to the buffet
you've been looking forward to...

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.959
- It's "we".
- And have a karaoke session...

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.400
that you've been longing for, right?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.239
Hey! I didn't suggest it.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.480
It was Mr. Shi's order.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.520
He told me to party with you
for a night.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760
He doesn't want you...

00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:07.799
to just work...

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.040
and think about things all day.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.719
- Fine, you're right.
- Go and get changed.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.976
I'll wash my hands and we can go.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
All right.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.640
Your birthday present is in my bag.
Open it yourself.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
Thank you.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.440
Is this my birthday present?

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.120
This is my breakfast for tomorrow.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.720
Tang Jia.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.999
You're just a nurse.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.520
Are you giving me
such a generous gift?

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.960
It's not a replica, is it?

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.000
That's against customs regulations.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.760
No.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.000
This is your birthday present.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.080
This is...

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.160
This is from Han Lie.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.080
He gave it to me today.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.160
Han Lie, Han Kui Long's son?

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.200
His older brother is in the ICU.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.320
He wants to thank me...

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.520
for taking care of his brother.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.359
He gave you a watch
that costs over 100,000 HKD...

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.080
to thank you for taking care
of his brother?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.079
I didn't know.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.319
I just saw it.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.560
You were the one who opened it.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.960
I told you not to get involved
with people like him.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.680
I didn't.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.199
He slipped it to me...

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.200
in front of the elevator
when I got off work today.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800
Say no more.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560
Let's go.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.120
Hurry and change your clothes.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.680
(Wang's Cafe)

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
This is Han Lie.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
It's Tang Xuan.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640
Madam.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160
What is it?

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.160
Can you get to the plaza
in Hongwawei in 15 minutes?

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720
Okay.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240
That's all.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720
Hello.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720
Hello, Inspector Tang.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880
It's Qin Yu.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.080
I'd like to talk to you again.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720
Sure.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.280
I'm near your place.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.120
Can we meet now?

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680
I'll call you later.

00:33:12.681 --> 00:33:13.760
I'm out right now.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960
All right then.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.680
What is it, Madam?

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.160
Did you find out who went
into my brother's room?

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040
Tang Xuan...

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360
Here's your watch back.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.880
It's not for you.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.880
I don't care
what your intentions are.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.520
From now on,

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.080
just stay away from her.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200
Why?

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.280
I don't want my family...

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.880
to be involved with the triad.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.040
What's wrong with the triad?

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960
Dad.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.680
Where are you?

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.560
I'm in front of the police station.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.640
What are you doing
in front of the police station?

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.520
Can you pick me up?

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.520
Okay.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.400
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right there.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.160
Judge Qin, I'm home.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.880
You can come anytime.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.759
It's too late today.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.760
Let's meet another time.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.239
Then, your son...

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.399
wore a doctor's gown...

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.440
to go and see Han Gang.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.399
Do you really think...

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.920
there's no connection
between all this?

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.896
You should bring him
to the police station immediately.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920
Let us do the questioning.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.920
That's the best way...

00:36:26.921 --> 00:36:28.840
to clear him of suspicion.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.760
Dad.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480
Don't say anything.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280
Eat something first.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.880
Yi Wei.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.200
If we stay here,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.280
all we'll remember...

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.200
are unhappy things.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.520
If I want to leave,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
will you come with me?

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160
Is it because of me?

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.480
It's because of us.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.520
If anything happens to you,
I won't be happy either.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.080
I also gave a false statement.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.600
If we really have to leave,

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280
let's leave together.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120
Okay.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.040
Great.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.960
We haven't come to that yet.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.320
Let's eat.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880
Okay.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.400
Give your son some vegetables too.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.840
Is it good?

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280
Yes.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280
Here, have some.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.280
Eat more.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800
Here, eat.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.360
Have some vegetables.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.720
Thank you, Dad.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720
Here.

00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:27.256
- Grandma will get some for you.
- It's good that you're back.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.160
This will always be your home.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.520
Cheer up.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.200
- Okay.
- Let's eat.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
It's okay.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.440
I'll give you some.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080
Is it good?

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.840
Eat more. Eat more if you like it.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880
Wei.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.040
Hey.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720
Can you help me?

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680
Wei.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.360
I won't make it hard for you.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.640
I don't need you to do anything.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.360
I'll arrange everything.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920
Will you do it?

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.240
Just tell me.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440
Today,

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.200
I'll return the favor I owe you.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.799
It's all arms and ammunition.
Be careful on the road.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800
Okay.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.000
Be safe, sir.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.920
What's wrong, Bin?

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360
I have diarrhea.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760
I can't hold it.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.320
I need to use the restroom.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.720
Give me five minutes. I'll be quick.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.520
Sir!

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.480
Don't you know you have a flat tire?

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760
Flat tire?

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.680
Aren't you going to ask me
why I'm here?

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.160
You'll tell me if you want to.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680
I think...

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.640
there's something
you'll want to know.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.480
Is that so?

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.840
Last night, around 7 or 8pm,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.879
I drove past the small plaza...

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.240
near Inspector Tang's home.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I saw her...

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.360
meeting with Han Lie.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.440
- Tang Xuan and Han Lie?
- Yes.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.840
Inspector Tang was holding...

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
an expensive watch box.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.080
You mean...

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.879
Han Lie seemed to be...

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.160
thanking Inspector Tang
for something.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.160
Actually,

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.960
it's already quite obvious.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.480
Inspector Tang wanted to conceal
Ma Shan Bao's alibi...

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.039
because she knew Han Kui Long...

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.920
would seek revenge
on the Old City Gang.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.440
To stop this bloodshed,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.600
she leaked this information...

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.800
to Han Lie.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.800
She chose...

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.720
to sacrifice Ma Shan Bao.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.800
She's a police officer.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.120
Does a police officer have the right
to disregard the life of a citizen?

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.760
You said you saw the two of them...

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.280
meeting in private.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.240
You also saw
Tang Xuan taking a bribe.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.280
They were just meeting.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.840
Inspector Tang could say...

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.800
she was collecting evidence
from Han Lie.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.320
She was holding the watch box,

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.120
but that doesn't mean
she accepted it.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.200
As a judge,

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320
I would also say...

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.920
there is insufficient evidence.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.120
Then why did you come...

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:25.960
to tell me this?

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.879
The police can use these clues...

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.600
to check the CCTV footage
in the vicinity...

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.240
to find the truth.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.840
Let me tell you what I think.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.160
Two weeks ago,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.400
you introduced a client to me.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.520
But you didn't tell me
that my client stole your car.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040
Later on,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.360
my client got involved
in Han Gang's case.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.960
You already knew about this.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.680
But once again,

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.400
you didn't tell me anything.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.440
Sure, you eventually told me.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.079
You even gave me an idea...

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.000
to bail my client out.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.960
But what happened in the end?

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040
You saw it too.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360
Today,

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:15.400
you suddenly came to me
and told me all this.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.559
Are you trying...

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.840
to turn this ridiculous story...

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.400
into something else?

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.120
Or are you trying to tell me...

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.200
what to do again?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240
Yes.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.280
You're right.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.280
This case...

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.640
does have something to do with me.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.480
Bin, thank you.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.160
You have half an hour.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.480
That's enough.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.400
Wei.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.320
I'm sorry.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040
I'll pay you back...

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.480
in the next life.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.560
SP650 is requesting backup.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.680
We've been attacked
on Shenshi Street.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.280
You're right.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.720
This incident...

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.400
has something to do with me.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.960
Because the driver...

00:45:31.961 --> 00:45:33.080
who hit Han Gang...

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.880
was my son,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880
Qin Yi Wei.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.760
I didn't want to drag you into this.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.080
I just wanted you
to help Ma Shan Bao.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.400
But what happened next...

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.080
went completely out of control.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.320
Judge Qin Yu.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.720
You were my teacher in law school.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.680
You taught me what the law is,

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960
what justice is,

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.760
and that the law cannot submit
to the unlawful.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.960
I've always respected you.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.200
That jerk. He said
I had half an hour.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120
Hands up!

00:46:58.121 --> 00:46:59.560
- Don't shoot!
- Freeze!

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.720
Don't shoot.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.480
- Don't move!
- Don't shoot!

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.919
Don't shoot!

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.319
- Hands up!
- Don't move!

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.320
Don't shoot.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.720
I don't want to force you.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.800
You can choose not to help me.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.120
Or you can pretend nothing happened.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.520
If you think I'm a bad person,

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.160
you can even report me.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.440
I won't help you.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.640
But I won't run away either.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.480
You want to know if I'll report you.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840
Is that it?

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600
You're a judge.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.080
Whether you're guilty or innocent,

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600
you decide for yourself.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.520
But I don't want
to listen to you anymore.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.600
I will use my own method...

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.840
to clear Ma Shan Bao's name.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800
Luo Wen.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760
I'm sorry.
