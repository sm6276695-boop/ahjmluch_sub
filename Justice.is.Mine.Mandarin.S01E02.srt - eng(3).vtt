00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
In the past few years,

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.439
violent conflicts between various triad gangs,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.759
along with last year's attacks on public officials,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.080
such as the police, prison guards and prosecutors,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.200
have tarnished the reputation of Hokong,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.680
which was known as the Monte Carlo of the East.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360
Nine months ago,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.519
after businessman Han Kui Long, who has triad connections,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
was sentenced,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.960
Hokong seemed to regain its peace.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.839
However, since early this morning,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.879
multiple brawls have erupted...

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.039
between Han Kuilong's triad...

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.320
and the Old City Gang.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.040
What the citizens are mostly concerned about now...

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.320
must be when Hokong will finally achieve lasting peace.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.240
It's the police! Go!

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
Freeze!

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920
Stop!

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.840
- Drop your weapons! - Stop! Get down!

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
Stay still!

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
Don't move!

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.079
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.080
- Stop! - Get down!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Stay still! Get down!

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.840
Get down!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
You! Stop!

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600
Stay still! Don't move!

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.200
- Go. - Go.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240
Let's go! Hurry!

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.080
(Justice is Mine)

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.080
(Episode 2)

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.320
I'm going to the police station later.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
Why?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.319
Our car has been found.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320
It has been found?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.960
Where did you take the car?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160
The point is,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
our car went missing.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.760
After we reported it,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880
it was found.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.760
We need to go to the police station to get it back.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.440
This is normal procedure.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
Don't worry.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.480
If they've found the car,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.080
they'll find out that I did it.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.840
They only found the car.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.480
They didn't say it hit someone.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480
After breakfast,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560
I'll take you to school.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.240
Just act normal.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.480
Don't be afraid.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040
Carry on eating.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.320
I'll be right back.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360
Bad news.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.520
The car was seized by the police.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
I know.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200
The police informed me.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.400
Why are they looking for you?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600
Is that car yours?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.400
Why would they impound my car?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.959
The kid who helped us take the car last night...

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960
was Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.240
He's my cousin's son.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.200
The police went to his mom early this morning.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.240
Then why did the police seize my car?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.000
Why did you dismantle it?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.960
Why is it a stolen car?

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.360
Wei, stop asking me questions.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560
I obviously asked for your help...

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.760
because there's something wrong with the car.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920
Tell me first.

00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:14.480
Why did they seize my car?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.159
I don't know if Bao was just unlucky...

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.160
or went the wrong way.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.359
He happened to run into the fight...

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.200
between Qi Chang Rong and Han Kui Long's men.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.439
His car was surrounded by the police.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
He got caught red-handed.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560
Now, the police...

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920
want to charge him with car theft...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
and driving without a license.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
Then...

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.880
What do you think we should do now?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.920
What else?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.040
Let's bail him out first.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.040
Is he related to Qi Chang Rong?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
Is this his first offense?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.840
He lives in the Old City District.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.359
He's bound to be involved...

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.560
with Qi Chang Rong somehow.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.480
Bao may be a small-time thug,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.760
but he wouldn't rob anyone.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.880
He's a good kid.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.120
We have to find a way to bail him out.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.640
I'll get him a lawyer.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.240
Given his current situation,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.200
shouldn't he seek legal aid?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040
Lawyer Zhou Luo Wen...

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.199
used to be my student.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200
She can help.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.760
How much is the lawyer's fee?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.040
Hello, Zhou Luo Wen's Law Firm.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600
Hello, Luo Wen.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200
Mr. Qin.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.519
Are you calling me for a ride?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.640
I happen to be free. I have nothing to do at the firm.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.000
No, I want to introduce a client to you.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760
Really?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
Yes.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280
It's an arrest for suspected car theft...

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480
that occurred last night.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.240
A Mr. Cao will contact you.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.560
Mr. Cao?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600
Yes.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840
Cao Wei Er.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.320
I'll give him your number.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Mr. Qin.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.800
This is my first case on my own.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.159
If I run into any problems,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160
you'll help me, right?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.160
Okay, of course.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.880
If you have any problems, you can call me anytime.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.960
Bye, Mr. Qin.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840
It's done.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.240
Call her and talk to her.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720
Also,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.160
most importantly, tell your nephew this.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.760
Before the lawyer arrives,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040
don't say anything.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.280
You know how it is.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240
I understand.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400
I'll get going then.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680
Judge Qin.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760
Are you going straight to the court?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.760
Take my son back to school first.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.240
Then, please take me to the Eastern District Police Station.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.880
It's my pleasure to serve my idol.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Drive safely.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360
I will.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.960
There was a serious car accident yesterday.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.560
Road safety should indeed be taken seriously.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.280
It was just reported on the news.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.559
The police have made a breakthrough...

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.360
in the hit-and-run investigation.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.679
But no related news has been released.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.560
The victim is still in critical condition.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.720
To hit someone and flee the scene...

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.960
I really don't know who could do such a heartless thing.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.599
Aren't they afraid of karma?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600
Stop the car.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.799
Dad, there's a bus stop here.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800
I want to take the bus.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800
Please stop the car.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040
Okay.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680
Is he okay?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720
Go straight to the police station.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840
Okay, I got it.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.840
- Turn off the radio. - Okay.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.919
What do you think...

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
of yesterday's case?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.319
Fighting over women,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.919
power, and territory...

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.239
are always common occurrences among gangs.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.360
It happens all the time.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.759
I guess you're concerned...

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.400
about Han Gang's hit-and-run case, right?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.119
Well, as the Intelligence Bureau's chief inspector,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.840
what do you think, Officer Shi?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.760
Now that Han Kui Long is in jail,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.800
Qi Chang Rong must want to use this opportunity to rise to power.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120
But...

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.839
Han Kui Long has been in dominance for years.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.359
It won't be easy for Qi Chang Rong...

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360
to take him down.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.560
And it'll be very troublesome.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.040
The higher-ups only care about one thing.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600
Stability.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200
It's simple.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
Then...

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.080
Let's give Han Kui Long a little treat first.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.079
Let him out to see his son.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.960
That'll cool him down, right?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.640
We'll discuss the rest later.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.720
As for the gang fight, it's a minor issue.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.880
Just consider it as saving on mess hall expenses.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.440
But we really need to follow Han Gang's hit-and-run case closely.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760
Reporting, Officer Da.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.479
Last night, two gangs were in an armed brawl.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480
Many were injured.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.320
It also involved criminal damage.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.040
As for whether it's related to Han Gang's car accident,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200
we're still investigating.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.680
There's no need to investigate.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800
Release everyone.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Release them?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.040
- We found out last night... - This is an order.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680
Do you not understand Chinese?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
When you leave,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
close the door gently.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840
Does it smell good?

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880
It's very fragrant.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.480
It's very smooth on the palate.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.879
- Yes, sir. - This is indeed much better...

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880
than the stronger ones.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.280
Judge Qin, you're so lucky.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.440
In the past,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.920
out of 10 cars reported missing in the Eastern District,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.040
not a single one could be found.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.400
But yours was found overnight.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160
Take a look.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.200
When we found the car,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.240
the headlights and door were damaged.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.919
If it wasn't damaged before you reported it missing,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.920
we need to write that down.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120
It wasn't damaged before.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680
Then sign here.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.680
Okay.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880
It's just a formality.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.120
We found the young man.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.640
He was driving without a license.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.320
You're lucky he didn't wreck your car completely.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160
Can I get my car back now?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160
Yes.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.439
Did you bring the car key?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.520
Do you want me to call a tow truck?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280
Yes, I did.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.080
- Okay, thank you. - Judge Qin.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.240
Is Judge Lu Wei De your competitor...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.600
for the position of Chief Justice?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.120
I think so.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.920
If there's anything I can do to help,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160
just let me know.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080
The court is a sacred place.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.000
We don't want it to be tainted by a rotten apple.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240
I'll do my best.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.680
But the most capable one will prevail.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.880
Judge Qin, about your car...

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280
After you get your car back,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280
remember to get it inspected.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.840
Also, change the headlights.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Safety comes first.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800
Thank you.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240
What happened to you?

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.400
Relax.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.120
Breathe with me.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280
Thank you.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160
Here.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.800
Are you feeling better?

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.320
Why didn't you come to the game yesterday?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680
Let's go.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480
By the way, Coach,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.520
I forgot my notes.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120
I'll get going.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.120
Mr. Long, you can probably guess...

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
how chaotic it is out there now that you're in here.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Right?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.920
There's no need to escalate things.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.800
Have some coffee first, Mr. Long.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
Give me some time.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.520
If you need it,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.080
I'll give you two days off.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.080
Go and see your son.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.440
Ask your men to go home and rest.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.000
There's no need to make things so tense.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.560
Nothing is certain yet.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.880
It's a waste.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720
Come on.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.799
Officer Hu, what are the orders from above?

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.280
Release all of the people we caught yesterday,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.840
no matter if they're from the Old City Gang...

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
or Han Kui Long's men.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600
What?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.840
We arrested three van-loads of people.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280
They assaulted people and damaged property.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440
We even busted...

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440
several newly discovered drug dealing spots.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440
You want me to release them now?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.120
Have you ever seen me drink coffee?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.080
Officer Hu, stop beating around the bush.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.000
It was decided by the ones who drink coffee.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.759
They said harmony is paramount.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.280
They don't want any complications.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.960
I'm sorry, Officer Shi.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.479
The coffee at the Eastern District Police Station...

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.720
is not as good as the coffee at headquarters.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.519
You had such a good time chatting with Chief Da.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
Why are you here?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.720
Han Kui Long's son is a human being.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.800
Are those who died by his hand not human too?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.120
How could you pity him and make a deal with him?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.120
If that's what you're saying,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.280
then Han Gang deserved what he got.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.680
Then are you going to let the person who hit him get away with it?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.880
I know you're angry.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.280
But we made an agreement.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.239
We can't let work affect our relationship.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.240
Right?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.240
However, on the other hand,

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.919
if your Regional Crime Unit...

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.120
needs help from our Intelligence Bureau,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.039
I certainly don't mind...

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.360
offering myself to you emotionally.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.560
Then let me ask you this.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.160
Is this considered mixing work with our private lives,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.280
or keeping them separate?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.520
What I mean is,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.440
I'll do anything for Inspector Tang without hesitation.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560
See you at our usual place.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.760
Judge Qin.

00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:29.880
Court starts in half an hour.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.840
Also, I wanted to tell you...

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.400
that Judge Shen is here.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.160
I'm retired.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.639
I'm not a judge anymore.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.159
I'm sitting here...

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.639
as Judge Qin's mother-in-law.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.879
Why didn't you tell me...

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.960
you were coming beforehand?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.000
So it's my fault?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.240
Should I come back tomorrow?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840
It's okay.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.440
I'll get going then.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.160
Have a seat.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200
Did you want to see me for something?

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.720
Your car was stolen.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.320
Why didn't you tell me?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.840
It was indeed stolen,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.400
but I got it back now.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560
I didn't want to alarm you.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.840
The car is registered in my name.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.519
I only found out...

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.080
when the Transportation Department notified me.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
I'm sorry.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.000
I don't want to find out everything after the fact.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.080
Don't forget.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.200
You still haven't given me an explanation...

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.920
for Lan Lan's death.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.000
Can we not discuss this...

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.640
before my court hearing?

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.240
I'm just worried about Wei Wei.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.720
You're so busy with work.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.200
Your car was even stolen.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.000
Who would dare to steal a judge's car?

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.999
Wei Wei is fine.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.080
I got the car back.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560
I'm really in a hurry.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880
Can we meet another time?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520
Madam.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520
We couldn't get anything out of him.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.040
The kid wouldn't talk.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.399
He's from the Old City District.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.520
He has a record for car theft.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.080
We suspect he works for Qi Chang Rong.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.240
I just don't get it.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.040
There were so many cars on the street.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.160
Why did he steal Judge Qin's car?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560
Keep interrogating him.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320
His lawyer is here.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880
She has been waiting for hours.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200
Should we keep making her wait?

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.840
It's a suspect's right to see a lawyer.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080
Let him see her.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.320
Okay.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
Madam.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880
We found something in the crime scene report.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.879
Forensics found paint marks on the motorcycle...

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.320
that don't match its paint.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600
They were probably left behind...

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:40.720
from a violent collision between two vehicles.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.800
Can they use these paint marks...

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.080
to identify the car?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.760
They can only tell if it's a European or Japanese car.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.280
From the headlight fragments found at the scene,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.720
Forensics says it's most likely a Japanese car.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.119
But we still need to find the car that hit the motorcycle...

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.240
and perform a forensic analysis to confirm it.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.000
You said it's a Japanese car?

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.960
There were signs of a collision,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.840
and there were headlight fragments found at the scene.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120
Yes, Madam.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.519
The police came to the school.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.720
I... I ran away.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680
Hello.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.600
Yes. I'm a student's parent.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.919
I saw some police officers at the school.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920
I wonder what's going on.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800
There was a theft report?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.280
Okay, thank you.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920
Come in.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040
Judge Qin.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.120
Inspector Tang is here.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.320
What is it, Inspector Tang?

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960
Judge Qin.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.400
Where is your car right now?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160
The doctor said...

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.440
that Han Gang's condition is stable for now.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.360
But his condition is critical.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.280
Most importantly,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.760
we need to see if Han Gang can wake up.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.080
My son won't die so easily.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.880
He'll definitely get better.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720
Dad.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.760
I don't think this happened to Han Gang...

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.440
by accident.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.799
You have to carefully take care of Han Gang now.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.160
Don't worry about anything else.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.080
Most importantly, don't do anything rash.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.440
It must have been Qi Chang Rong and his men!

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.800
That's why they threw Han Gang to the roadside like trash.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.960
No one else would dare to do that.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.840
Just go and do what you like.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.160
In the future,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.040
my position belongs to your elder brother.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.240
There are many things you don't understand.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.840
When he wakes up,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.360
he will know what to do.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840
Dad.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.200
It's not that I want to interfere.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.200
I just want to tell you...

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.560
that he's not just your son.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.040
He's also my elder brother.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.600
I went to the scene.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.720
It might've been left by the person who hit Hang Gang.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.360
Okay.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.200
Give it to Ms. Lin.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.840
She'll know what to do.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.240
Give it to the police.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.160
Let them do their job.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.680
I don't trust them.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.480
Just do as I say!

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.720
Do you know why...

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.720
I'm trying to keep you out of this?

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.880
It's a precaution.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.200
I have two sons.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.000
I need to have a backup plan.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.120
Do you really think...

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.840
that Judge Qin is capable of convicting me...

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320
and sending me to jail?

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.000
There's a lot of chaos in Hokong.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.640
It's not as simple as you think.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600
The headlights have been replaced,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.520
but the scratches haven't been repaired.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.360
Yes.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.319
That's because the scratches...

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.800
need to be repaired at the shop.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.079
Since they don't affect how the car drives,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.880
I'm going to get it repaired during the holidays.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360
Where did you get it repaired?

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.519
I'm not sure which repair shop it was.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.600
The court's driver arranged it.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.680
Hello?

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.640
Go to the court's designated repair shop now.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.560
A champagne gold Accord...

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.440
had its headlights replaced there.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.639
Get all the parts and fragments...

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.640
and bring them back to me.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.920
Okay.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.279
Is there something...

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.360
I need to know?

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.920
Judge Qin.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.280
We now suspect...

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.160
the car that hit Han Gang...

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.960
is the one you reported stolen.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640
Did the suspect confess?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.440
No, he didn't say anything.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.360
But we have enough evidence...

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.720
to suggest that it's highly likely.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440
So for now,

00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:42.479
we'll have to impound your car...

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.760
and let the Forensic Division handle it.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.000
They will collect evidence and conduct lab tests.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.200
That includes the scratches on the car,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320
the broken headlights,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.560
and this paint.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.920
Please sign here...

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
and give me the car keys.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800
When the Forensic Division is done,

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040
they'll notify you.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320
How long will it take?

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.359
Don't worry. I'll tell them...

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360
to expedite the process.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320
Judge Qin.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.880
Inspector Tang.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.320
You've joined forces again?

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.200
Who's the unlucky idiot this time?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.120
Judge Qin is the light of justice in our court.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.320
You have the support of the police force now,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.480
and your public approval is also high.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.320
If you run for Chief Justice,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680
your reputation...

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.760
will truly be high.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.040
You're too kind, Judge Lu.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.800
I'll leave you to it.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.600
The unstoppable duo!

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080
Judge Qin.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.880
I have another favor to ask of you.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.559
You can tell me who hit you.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560
I can sue them.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.759
Did they threaten you?

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.760
Are they falsely accusing you?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.319
If you don't tell me,

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.600
they might hit you harder next time.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.920
As long as you're brave enough to step forward,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.440
I can sue them for excessive violence.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720
There's no need.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.720
I... don't want any more trouble.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.760
You have other troubles?

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.039
Are you trying to take me back...

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.240
to be formally investigated?

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.200
If so, I believe...

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.000
you need some legal documents.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.240
You're not being investigated.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520
You're assisting the investigation.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.560
Come with us to identify the suspect.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.160
Early this morning,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.039
Han Kui Long and Qi Chang Rong's men...

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.920
got into a brawl during a turf war.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.800
A dozen were injured, with three in critical condition.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.920
This is common for them.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.719
If Han Kui Long finds out...

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720
that one of Qi Chang Rong's men...

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720
hit his son,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.520
who knows how many more will die?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.600
Then what can you do?

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.919
I can catch the real culprit...

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.560
who hit Han Gang as soon as possible...

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.800
and bring him to justice.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.360
That will give Han Kui Long an answer.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.720
That's the best way to quell this storm.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160
Otherwise,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.720
this will never end.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.199
I know you have a record of car theft...

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.600
and other thefts.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.480
But you got off lightly because you were a minor.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
That's all in the past.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.880
You're 18 this year.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.560
They'll charge you as an adult.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.240
Perhaps, I can find another way to plead for you.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120
For example,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.120
your family's situation.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.080
Before I came here,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.640
I met your mother.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960
She's very worried about you.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.640
She kept asking me...

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.400
when you can go home.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720
Your mother said...

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.880
that your family can't live without you.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.080
You have three younger siblings,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.080
and your father is gone.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.080
You're the family's only support.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.960
I need you to tell me...

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.679
everything that happened...

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.800
before you were arrested.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.200
I need to know every detail.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.440
That's the only way I can help you.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.720
I'm your lawyer.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.800
It's my job...

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.560
to protect your rights.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.720
Remember.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.679
When you're being interrogated,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.360
you must request to have a lawyer present.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.200
And I...

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960
am your lawyer.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800
Understand?

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920
Judge Qin,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.720
if you need me to follow procedures...

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.160
and make an official request...

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.679
for you to assist with the investigation,

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.840
I can do that.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.560
But between you and me,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.560
do we have to be so formal?

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.880
The sooner we resolve this,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.240
the fewer innocent people get hurt.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400
Judge Qin,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.840
could you please help me just this once?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200
Sure.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320
Inspector Tang,

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.599
I don't want my name or identity...

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600
to be exposed.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120
Also,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.359
although the registered owner...

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.360
is my mother-in-law,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.080
just come directly to me if you need anything.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.240
She's a retired judge, after all.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.520
I don't want to bother her.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240
I completely understand.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280
Judge Qin,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.079
I know you're a little nervous...

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.160
because Han Kui Long is involved in this case.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720
But I promise you...

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.440
that all information will be kept confidential.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.680
You just need to help identify the culprit later.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.880
Okay.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.239
Are we going to the identification room now?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240
Of course.

00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:14.640
The culprit won't be able to see you in that room.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880
Don't worry.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.800
Let's go.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240
- Jerk! - Hey!

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.240
Guo Hua.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.280
- Don't frame me! - Calm down!

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560
I didn't steal the car!

00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:34.679
Don't frame me! I didn't steal the car!

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.039
Jerk! I didn't!

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.640
- Hold him down! - I didn't do it!

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.640
I didn't! I didn't!

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.399
The police stole the car!

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.320
It was the police who stole it!

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.760
Not me!

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.159
I wasn't me!

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160
Let go!

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560
Sorry, madam.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560
Sorry, Judge Qin.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.320
Take him away!

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.839
I'm so sorry, Judge Qin.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840
I hope that didn't scare you.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.360
No.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.240
The suspect seemed to know you.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
Do you remember...

00:31:13.761 --> 00:31:14.999
under what circumstances you saw him?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.400
Do you have any impression of this person?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760
I remember that day...

00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:21.240
I left home around 10am.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.200
I remember he was across the street from my house.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200
Okay.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.240
I'm really sorry.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
I'll walk you downstairs.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280
Here.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640
Wei Wei.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560
Recently,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.600
your car was stolen.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.880
Do you know what happened?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.440
Did my dad tell you?

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.000
Of course, he wouldn't tell me.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.719
But the Transport Department...

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.799
saw the car was registered in my name,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.960
so they informed me the car had been found.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.240
Your neighborhood has always been safe.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.360
How did the car get stolen?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400
Wei Wei.

00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:10.639
If you ever run into any problems,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.080
you have to tell Grandma, okay?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.960
Don't be like your mom.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.200
Grandma, that's enough.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960
I'm leaving.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200
Wei Wei.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.920
That young boy just now...

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.920
Why does he have so many scars on his face?

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760
He resisted arrest.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.240
He just stole a car.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.040
Did they have to be so rough?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.680
Judge Qin.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.240
He's not an ordinary kid.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.760
He's from the Old City District.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400
Just last month,

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600
one of my subordinates...

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.280
was stabbed by someone from Old City.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.640
He's still in the hospital.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.760
He was driving a stolen car.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.359
Who knows if he had a knife...

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.400
or a gun on him?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.680
If you were me,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.400
would you risk your life?

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600
You can't be merciful...

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.040
when dealing with criminals.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200
Please stop the car.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120
Yi Wei.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.720
Yi Wei.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
Don't go!

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.239
It's a police officer in the car.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240
Don't run.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280
Dad.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.080
The police came to find me at school.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920
I asked them.

00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:35.359
It was a theft case. It has nothing to do with you.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.400
Don't be afraid.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.000
Just let them arrest me.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.360
Then you won't be implicated.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.120
Do you think you'll be safe as long as you get arrested?

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.799
Do you think Han Kui Long will let you off?

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.880
Will he let me off?

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.440
You're grown up now.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.720
Weren't you going to call the police?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.319
There's a police officer right behind you.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.479
What do you want to tell her?

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.040
Tell her.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520
Qin Yi Wei.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.640
What did you do to make your dad so angry?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.360
Do you have something to say?

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240
It's nothing.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360
He's supposed to be an adult now.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.960
I don't know what he's thinking sometimes.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.480
That's how young people are.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.960
Get in the car.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Your Honor.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.959
The defense believes that the actions of my client,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.160
Ma Shan Bao,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.520
do not constitute car theft.

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.279
Instead, he drove a car...

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.959
that he didn't know was reported stolen.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.000
That's why he was arrested.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.560
During the interrogation,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.159
there's reason to suspect...

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.480
that excessive police force was used.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.240
Therefore, the defense...

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.720
questions the legitimacy...

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
of the charges.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.480
Your Honor.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.040
Defense Counsel...

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.199
didn't question the police investigation...

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.280
until now.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.000
Now, they're deliberately bringing it up.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.000
They're clearly trying to confuse the court's deliberation.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400
Your Honor.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.360
The defense insists on bail pending trial.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.000
Please transfer my client to a safe location.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400
Defense Counsel.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.080
I will reject your request.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.800
Because I have received information...

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.519
that is not yet suitable...

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.079
for public disclosure in court.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.600
Not suitable for public disclosure?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.960
Your Honor.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200
Regarding all the suspicions...

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.800
raised by the defense,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.480
I believe the prosecution...

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.320
should carry out...

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.280
a seven-day supplementary investigation.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.680
At that time,

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.080
the trial will resume.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.280
During these seven days,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.280
Ma Shan Bao...

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.240
will remain in police custody.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.040
Bail pending trial is denied.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840
Bao.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840
- Mom. - Bao, are you okay?

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840
I'm fine.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.640
I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760
Don't say anything.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.760
You'll be fine.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.360
Why is he being detained for seven days?

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.320
Didn't you say he'd go home soon?

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520
Ms. Chen.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
Give me some time.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200
Please trust me.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.960
Madam.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.960
This is the lab report on Judge Qin's car.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.600
Why didn't you give it to the Regional Crime Unit?

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.400
Mr. Long doesn't trust them.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.520
So I'm trustworthy?

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680
I trust you.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.160
Hello.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160
Judge Qin.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.920
I'm sorry for disturbing you again.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.360
Go ahead, Inspector Tang.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.600
I just wanted to let you know...

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.720
that your car will be temporarily impounded.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.600
The lab report is out.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.080
It confirms that your car...

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.280
was the one that hit Han Gang.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800
Okay.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.600
I'll cooperate fully with the investigation.
