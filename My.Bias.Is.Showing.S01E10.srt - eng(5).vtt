00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.490
Since when did it begin?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610
I hope our first kiss

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.370
will linger on

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.460
in your memory.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.720
Was it when we had our first kiss?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.280
I was listening to your song.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.890
Your lyrics are, how should I put it...

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.180
They're rich and resonate with me.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450
Really comforting.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.580
Or when you said you liked my song

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.870
and smiled at me?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.680
Or...

further back,

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.479
when we spent our first night together?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.250
Are you... okay?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.220
Maybe it started when

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.990
I first met you.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.510
Since then, I've been spending every day

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.350
and every moment in my life...

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.520
So cute.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.870
Seeking Na Aejoon.

Let's pretend nothing happened between us.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.360
Aejoon-hyung, wait. Let me finish.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.010
I don't trust you anymore!

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.120
And I'd never been sincere with you.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.420
I miss you.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.090
I miss you, Na Aejoon.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.560
I miss you.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.329
I've liked you since a long time ago.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.640
Although I haven't forgiven you yet,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.240
I...

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.440
I want you to know that
I've liked you for a long time.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990
Thank you.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.090
It's okay even if you don't forgive me.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.110
Thank you so much.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.230

[Episode 10:
Thank You for Coming Into My World]

Ji Kyusung.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.880
Yeah?

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.040
I'm so mad that I thought
I shouldn't confront you, but...

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.050
But it's bugging me so much

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.310
that I can't sleep at night.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.750
You,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.950
come with me.

Now!

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.990
What's wrong with him?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.120
What do you want?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.200
How old is your new boyfriend?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.540
What?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.170
You broke up with me
because you found someone new.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.030
Is he younger than me?

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.160
Yeah.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.030
He's a-around 25...

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.730
No.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.570
He's 25 years old.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.970
Show me his photos.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.840
What for?

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.780
You must have photos of your boyfriend.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.050
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.130
Let me see if he's prettier than me.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.570
Show it to me!

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.490
Or you could video-call him too.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.540
Hurry up.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.810
Yeon Jooha!

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.340
Did you call me out in such a hurry

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.380
just for this?

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.470
Forget it.

Now's not the time for this.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.100
I'll send you back.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.520
Sit down.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.090
Before I raise my voice.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.730
Okay.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.080
I told you before, didn't I?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.520
If you don't make it clear
and try to gloss over it, I'll kill you.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.390
Hey, how can you be so harsh—

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.940
The reporter Han Yeonsu
has been stalking me.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.560
What?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.780
He asked me if I broke up
with the guy I was seeing

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.990
and why we broke up.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.820
Damn it. I thought
I'd gotten him off your tail.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.200
So? What did you say?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.300
Why?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.760
Scared that I said we were still dating?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.950
You're just about to
begin a major project.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.550
If this scandal hinders your career—

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.070
I...

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.060
I thought you'd...
really found someone new.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.970
I thought you'd really abandoned me.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.010
Oh? Isn't that Yeon Jooha?

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.400
Yeon Jooha?

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.380
I've always hated this about you.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.180
You never talk things out with me
and come to conclusions on your own.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.290
This pissed me off so much
that I wanted to just forget about it...

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.190
but I just can't get over
how ridiculous this is.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.940
I'm sorry.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.880
I was wrong.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.410
The exams are finally over.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.840
The students and teachers
of Nabit High School have all worked hard.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.420
Congratulations.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.470
Congratulations!

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.740
Speaking of which,
it's such a pity, Mr. Na.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.980
Aren't there just three sessions
of my internship left?

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.860
That's right.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.960
But you have to return to your actual job,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.610
so it can't be helped.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.710
So, for the students who finished
the college entrance exam,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.240
I've prepared a huge gift today.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.790
Let's go present it to them together!

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.250
I'm looking forward to it.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.940
It's the last of "Go! School Teacher."

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.750
Let's get started right now!

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.010
Cut!

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.290
Time for the slate.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.180
Take a break while we make adjustments.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.330
Is the footage okay?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.610
Okay.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.930
For the next scene...

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.320
Um, can I speak to

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.220
Siyeol's manager?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.420
Yes.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.010
I'll be right back.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.590
-What's wrong?
-Well...

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.320
Can we switch these two dates?

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.660
I told you we can't.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.710
Please show up on the day
of the school festival.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.140
Isn't the whole period the festival?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.270
What,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.870
I have to return to my actual job,

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.580
so it can't be helped?

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.780
Pfft.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.010
Why are you acting like
we'll never meet again?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.920
That hurt my feelings.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.220
I told you

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.390
I haven't forgiven you yet.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.920
Even if you haven't,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.230
you'll give me a pass, won't you?

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.100
Am I wrong?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.270
The stars of the show, please come here.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.110
-This way.
-Yes, okay.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.950
Well...

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.440
Mr. Na, you're so handsome.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.780
Tell us your IG handle!

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.620
What's with that response?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.600
Also, he's getting way too popular.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.070
This is worrying.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.100
Thank you so much, really.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.980
When you agreed to stay on until the end,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.310
I didn't show it,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.010
but I was really happy.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.180
Don't mention it.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.350
I should be apologizing.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.090
Now I know why workplace romance is taboo.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.640
There aren't many days left.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.990
I'll do my best until the end.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.680
Thank you.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.750
So, have you thought about
what I asked you last time?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.700
About what?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.920
About the reality dating show.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.470
Oh... that?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.590
-The date has changed.
-Yeah.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.590
What's the shooting schedule like?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.510
-The schedule?
-Yes.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.280
I'll find out.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.130
Okay.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.720
I think it's the following month.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.380
The following month?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.050
Yes.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.980
It's the school holidays.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.110
That's right.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.370
Oh?

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.740
What's the shooting schedule like?

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.370
Seriously, how can a person
suddenly change so much?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.240
Anyway,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.550
don't even think about

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.160
reality dating shows,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.370
you hear me?

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.450
I kind of want to see you cry again.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.950
Hey.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.160
Why aren't you answering me?

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.860
Got it.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.600
Nobody would catch my eye anyway,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.000
when you're right by my side.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.410
I was scared for a moment.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.450
No matter how I look at it,
you totally have the upper hand now.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.160
You think so too, right?

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.360
What?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.860
Why are you laughing?

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.060
Well, I've been a longtime fan of A-One,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.570
but I don't think
I've ever seen you like this.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.380
It's surprising.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.700
I find it surprising too.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.900
Not to sound too cocky,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.710
but I've never been the clingy one
in a relationship.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.800
But now I'm screwed.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.430
I'm so obsessed with you.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.970
You're all I can think about, Na Aejoon.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.580
That's a good thing.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.450
Keep it up.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.730
Oh!

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.610
What is this?

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.140
Oh, that? A present for you.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.410
It's new merch.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.200
I didn't want to ruin mine,
so I've never worn it.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.970
Awesome. I love it.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.560
So you already have one.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.820
You know what,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.410
I think you like idol Choi Siyeol
more than you like me.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.790
Didn't I hear this line

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.200
in one of my dreams?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.570
Oh, of course not.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.780
See?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.790
You can't even answer.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.640
Are you jealous?

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.390
This is also you, though.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.470
So,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.570
I want you to like me more.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.540
Oh, come on, how can I
like you more than I do now?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.760
Why can't you?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.840
My love for you keeps growing by the day.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.920
How about you just... move in with me?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.560
Move in?

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.820
Who's that?

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.690
Did you order takeout?

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.810
Hey, Choi Siyeol.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.780
Why are you both here?

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.770
I'm hungry.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.220
We bought champagne.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.160
Here.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.880
It's super expensive.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:35.800
Here.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.580
Thank you.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.370
You said you weren't coming
after that day.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.730
What happened?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.950
Now that you're in a relationship,
you've become so cold to me.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.600
Pfft.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.550
I mentioned I was coming today
ahead of time.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.860
You did?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.940
To whom?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.930
To Aejoon.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.100
Ae... Aejoon?

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.710
I heard they met outside,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.240
and they exchanged numbers.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.960
Wait, you've

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.730
already dropped honorifics with him?

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.190
That's because

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.760
we're the same age.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.200
We both understand give and take,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.000
so we got close very quickly.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.720
Give and...

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.770
take?

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.650
These are really rare!

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.700
I was so depressed when I didn't win it.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.010
Thank you so much!

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.990
Just let me know if you need anything.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.060
So, were you close to Ji Kyusung
since childhood?

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.370
Yeah, of course!

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.130
I have a photo of him in kindergarten.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.740
Do you want it?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.030
Do you have to ask? Come on!

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.070
Tada.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.860
Wait,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.230
why did he look like a troublemaker?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.520
Right?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.770
So cute!

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.640
Is that cute?

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.710
I also have a photo of Choi Siyeol
waking up when he was a trainee.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.210
Is it wrong to show you this?

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.140
Of course not!

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.310
Wait. I'll look for more photos.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.180
What is it?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.990
Tell me.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.240
Well...

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.560
I thought Jooha was a nice guy,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.360
but he's far better than I expected.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.660
I was wondering

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.910
who my dear Siyeol
became so obsessed over.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.130
You have a good eye for people.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.160
What's wrong with you two?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.520
What are you two up to?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.570
Enough about that.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.870
Let's toast!

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.700
Raise your glasses.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.530
You too.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.190
The people I like are all here.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.900
Wait, wait.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.810
People?

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.300
Am I not the only one you like?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.540
The public should see this side of Siyeol.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.110
Well, Ji Kyusung is annoying sometimes,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.600
but he's still family
that I can't live without,

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.850
and the other's Jooha,
a great friend I met thanks to Ji Kyusung.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.090
And...

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.180
I still can't believe it,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.140
but the Siyeol whom
I'd been fantasizing about.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.660
I'm unbelievably happy

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.600
that we're all gathered here together.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.690
You're right.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.350
It's great.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.160
Cheers.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.630
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.480
Do you have more champagne?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.130
No. Go home.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.530
We're planning to stay until dawn.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.730
Seriously, why are you
intruding on our date?

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:49.980
Don't you have shoots tomorrow?

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.910
No.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.260
Why do you think I'm here?

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.970
Jooha.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.120
We're still in the honeymoon phase.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.580
Gosh.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.780
Sometimes,

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.460
life takes you to unexpected places.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.400
What time did you get here?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.339
Aren't you cold?

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.760
Yeah.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.140
Give me your hand.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.960
When I'm done with the movie,
want to go on a trip?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.770
Hmm... Where do you want to go?

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.050
Good job today.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.400
Good job today.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.260
See you at the dinner.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.050
Let's go.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.860
Okay.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.600
Protecting something

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.890
requires a lot of resolve

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.500
and determination.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.450
Oh... A contract-based position?

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:47.650
Yes.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.220
Just for another year,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.780
and then we'll consider
a permanent position for you.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.670
Just do as you've done so far,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.480
keeping a low profile
and focusing on classes.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.920
You've been doing well,
haven't you, Mr. Na?

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.130
[One-Year Extension of
Fixed-Term Teacher Contract]

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.110
For responsibilities,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.820
you have to make a lot of sacrifices.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.090
Okay.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.160
I'll do my best.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.700
[Mom]
[Don't send me any more money, Aejoon.]

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.370
[Mom]
[Your siblings have grown up.]

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.830
[Mom]
[I'm grateful for all you've done so far.]

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.750
[Mom]
[I just want you to be happy.]

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.090
Be happy?

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.730
Principal.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.620
Yes?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.930
I'm sorry, but...

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.950
I'm quitting after the next semester.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.130
W-What did you say?

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.690
I don't want to keep a low profile.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.440
I want to teach kids in an institute

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.670
that needs me more.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.810
Mr. Na Aejoon...

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.290
To seek what you want,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.380
how much time and hardship
will it take?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.450
Wait.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.290
Mr. Na.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.010
Mr. Na!

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.190
Is Siyeol busy
for the second half of the year?

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.200
Is he interested in hosting a music show?

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.610
A music show?

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.830
I thought he only had his looks to offer,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.530
but he's also musically talented.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.000
I'll get back to you
once I check his schedule.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.460
Ready.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.280
Action.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.570
You never know what your hard work

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.570
might amount to;

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.200
if any good comes out of it...

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.750
It's so good.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.110
Insane.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.020
Yes, it's his turn now!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.770
This concept is so insanely good.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.550
His agency didn't disappoint.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.530
But sometimes...

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.250
luck also works in your favor.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.860
Amid the banality and frustrations
of everyday life,

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.420
like my bias who suddenly
came into my life,

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.460
I hope everyone can be blessed with

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.390
a welcome

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.160
surprise.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.780
Your performance today was so cool.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.890
I watched it ten times!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.280
Did you come right after the show?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.310
Yeah.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.350
I missed you so much,
so I came straight after.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.060
Coming home to the one you love

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.590
is awesome.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.270
I just stayed home,
and the one I love showed up.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.770
Na Aejoon!

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.270
How about I lock you up in my house
for the rest of my life?

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.770
What?

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.390
Thank you for showing up in my life.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.110
Thank you for coming into my world.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.450
Oh, right!

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:51.470
["Go! School Teacher" Season 2]

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.340
Nice to meet you again.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.420
Let's have a great time.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.420
"Go! School Teacher" was well received
and scheduled to be aired on TV.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.450
And my bias whom
I'm in a secret relationship with...

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.070
is still always flirting with me.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.190
Let's take a group photo.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.100
Okay.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.440
Okay. Come on.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.440
Everyone, squeeze in.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.840
Squeeze in.
Hyunji, hunch a little more.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.510
Minjin and Joonseo, squeeze in.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.530
Okay.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.330
Here we go.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.670
One, two, three!
