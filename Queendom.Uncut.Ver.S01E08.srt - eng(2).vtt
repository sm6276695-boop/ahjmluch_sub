00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.040
Morning, Rey.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.280
Morning, Print.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.000
I don't want to get up at all...

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.520
You've been in my body so long
you've become a sleepyhead.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.800
Can we just...
stay like this all day?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.600
But...

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
I don't even want to sleep.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.640
Should we go back to our bed?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.800
Why are we going back to bed
if we aren't gonna sleep?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
That's heavy.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
Sorry.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.520
I'll go on a diet.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.920
This actually reminds me of
when we first reunited.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.160
I think we'd easily nail mirror acting

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.160
if we do it now.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.800
Is that so?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.880
Should we give it a try?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.640
Print, you can start.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.320
That's a ten outta ten.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.280
Right,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.440
have you seen the filming schedule?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.240
We'll get to go to the beach
for the last scenes!

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.280
The last scenes...

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.520
Are you alright?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.280
I'm just wondering...
If the filming is all done,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.600
what would happen to us?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.960
Look at you being all dramatic.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.080
The filming's done,
not us.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.760
You don't get it!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.240
I probably wouldn't be seeing you
every day, Rey...

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.720
And we wouldn't be joined
at the hip like this!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.080
Then, let's spend time together
at the beach on this occasion.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.560
But it's nothing like a vacation!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.680
There will be tons of people;

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.360
plus, Mai and Fon

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.720
will supervise us like crazy.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.280
What are you now?

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.640
A sad puppy?

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.920
Actually, there are some ways
around it

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.680
that can give us some alone time...

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.000
So not a puppy anymore?

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.200
What are you now?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.720
Rey's girlfriend.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.600
Isn't Rey's girlfriend the cutest?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.440
- Father,
- Hmm?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.560
I'd like to ask
for the gift you gave me.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.160
Uh, why are you changing your mind now?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.520
Isn't it nice riding in a car
with a chauffeur?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.920
I just happen to need it now.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680
It's a free day today.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.640
- Do you want to go swimming with me?
- Mm!

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.880
Wait, but I can't swim, Print.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.520
I'll teach you how.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.920
Okay.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.360
Since the staff arranged
only two people per room,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.120
Print, you'll be sharing one with me,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.800
and Rey will be with Saifon.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.960
Um, but Mai...

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.040
- Rey and I...
- Wait,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.440
but these two have to run through
the lines together, don't they?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.440
Right, then maybe it's better
that you share a room,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.840
so you guys can do just that!

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.800
I'll just room with Mai.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040
Why the long face?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.560
You don't wanna be my roommate?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.040
Well, then, feel free
to open up a new room.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.560
Yeah?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.520
Go.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.640
Go on.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.200
Focus on the rehearsal!
That's right...

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.640
Help me pick my outfit.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.720
How about this?

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.000
Here.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.800
This one?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.920
It's too revealing.
Can we not?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.960
What about this?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.160
It's even pink.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.360
You like the color, don't you?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.320
Not anymore.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.840
This is what grown-ups wear.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.960
Fine.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960
There you go.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440
Turn around.
Let me apply it for you.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.280
Are you not gonna do my face anymore?

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.120
Uh-uh. That's cute.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.000
Leave it like that.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.920
Do you wanna go to the other pool?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.000
Uh-uh.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.960
That way, you can practice swimming

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.080
in case we have to switch back
by jumping into water.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.640
Do you trust me, Rey?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.200
Don't you let me go.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.280
I'm scared...

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.240
You have nothing to be scared of
around me, Rey.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.400
Are they totally an item,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.120
or is it just me?

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.800
I'm with you.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.200
I understand you...

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.960
and know you by heart.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.840
Mm, you really do.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.120
It's not often I see Print
smiling like this.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.400
Maybe someone gives her the reason to.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.360
[Biggie loves Littie]

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.560
You seeing what I'm seeing?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.160
Look how happy
Rey and Print are together.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.480
Let me be real with you.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.760
Do you really have a heart
to get in their way

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.720
and let them end up like us?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.400
Even if I don't,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.720
it's impossible between them.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.320
Is it really impossible,
or do you just never believe it can be?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960
Hi.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.480
- Let's eat something.
- Mm!

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.440
- This table?
- Okay.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.400
Wanna try this?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.680
Hey,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.200
- Hm?
- you guys...

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.080
look so much closer
after filming together.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.400
Right, my friend has
a girl's love project coming up.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.960
I think you guys are the perfect fit

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.280
since your chemistry
is really good together.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.320
You interested?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.760
- We are!
- We are!!

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.960
Awesome.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.320
I'll have my friend give you a call.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.600
Right.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800
It's gonna be a big hit if it's you two.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.480
- Let's eat!
- Let's dig in!

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.400
What project
were you discussing earlier?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.640
Um... Mother...

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.520
How did you get here?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.640
It's a wrap-up after all.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.440
I'd need to be here
to cheer on you, Rey.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480
You should have told me in advance.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.080
It wouldn't be a surprise if I did.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.840
Or is there a surprise for me, too?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.800
Mai,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.720
were you the one
calling Miss Duen here?

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.240
Mai!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.920
If I had known she was coming,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.200
would I have let Print and Rey
be in the same room?

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.560
Sorry.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.680
With Miss Duen here,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.520
it would be such a pain for those two.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.200
Like I've said,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.280
it's nearly impossible
between these two.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.200
What should we do?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.560
Mother certainly wouldn't let us
work together again.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.280
Don't worry, Rey.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.080
I'll find a way for her to open up.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.800
How would you do that?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.520
How about I talk to her first
in your body?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.440
Maybe she'll let her guard down a bit.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.080
That's a good idea, Print.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.520
You can do this.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.160
Since you drove all the way here for me,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.800
you must be feeling really sore.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.520
Just slightly.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.440
Why don't you go sit there a little?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.760
You are quite good at massaging.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.160
Where did you learn this?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.760
Print taught me how.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.480
She said she always
gave her mom a massage,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.720
so I thought you might like it, too.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.520
You've certainly become
quite close to Print, haven't you?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.880
Working together on set,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.160
I started to realize
that she's very sweet.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.120
We share the same work ethic,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.400
so we get along really well.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.240
Since I've found
a perfect duo to work with,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.360
and Pong has presented us
with a new project,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.040
it would be nice

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.480
working with her once again.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.960
You've changed a lot, Rey.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.200
I used to help you win against Print,

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.880
so why does it seem like
you're defending her now?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.960
Boo!

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.040
You're silly.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.640
You were able to sneak out
quicker than I thought, Print.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.920
If your mother didn't fall asleep
because she was tired...

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.640
I don't think
I'd ever see the light again.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.200
We got to come to the beach,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.520
yet there's barely time for us together.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.400
Have you tried to win Mother over?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.560
I even think
I got some points taken off.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.720
My Print...

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.840
is kind,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.600
thoughtful,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.960
and good at taking care of others.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.640
If Mother sees those in you,

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.960
she will surely give us the green light.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.800
What are you doing?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.240
I've heard that if you make a wish
at exactly 11:11 P.M.,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.320
it will come true.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
And what are you wishing for?

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.320
I wish for your mother
to cave in...

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.880
and for us to work together again

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.480
so that we can spend
even more time together.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040
Then,

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.320
I'll help you pray for those, Print.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.880
Come on.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.080
Did you say you were helping?

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.960
That was even longer than I did.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.480
You must really wanna
spend time with me.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.240
Mm!

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.560
I want to spend
lots and lots of time with you.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120
And...

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.320
I'll help Mother see
the good in you,

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.400
just like I do.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.600
I guarantee you

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.360
our wishes will come true.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.520
Hi, Auntie.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.200
Auer!

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480
How have you been?

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.920
This is the last scene, isn't it?

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.040
I'm glad to see you
working with Rey again.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.080
I am, too.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.440
Would you like some fruit, Auntie?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.360
Why don't you take a seat here, Auntie?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
You might get sore.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.920
I was just starting to feel sore.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.160
Thank you, Auer.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.520
Please take a seat.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.600
Uh...

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.200
If you're not in the mood for fruit,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.240
would you prefer a glass of juice?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.400
Mai!

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.160
Could you get me some coffee?

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.160
Of course.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.440
Would that dame know
that's her own daughter?

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.600
You're not any different,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.240
so good at getting in her hair.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.400
I'm just doing my job.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.360
Don't use your job as an excuse.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.280
People like you just know nothing
about love.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.360
Whatever makes you happy.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.320
Mai!

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.120
I miss you so bad!

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.320
This is Jane!

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.520
How did you get here?

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.680
Did you forget

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.320
I'm a sponsor of the product
that Rey and Auer will be filming today?

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.760
Since today's their last vlog,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.200
there's no way I'd ever miss it.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440
I forgot about that.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.600
Does it mean I have to call you
"Miss Jane" now?

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.280
You're so dramatic!

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.600
Just call me Jane,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.120
or Little Jane if you'd like.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.960
Alright.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.960
Well, are you busy?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560
A little.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.800
Oh, hi there!

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400
Hi, there.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
I'm Jane!

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.760
Saifon here.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.040
I'm over the moon.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.040
Miss Rin, please be careful.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.440
You could topple over.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.040
Rey is really talented.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.480
Actually...

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.240
I have something
I'd like to confess to you,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.280
but could you promise
you won't tell Rey?

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.400
What is it about?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.400
Do you remember

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.560
how Rey and I have been
competitive since childhood?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.520
Even though people saw us as rivals,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.840
I've actually...

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.800
secretly admired her all this time.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.040
And even before working together,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.400
I've seen some of Rey's work.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.200
I know she was good,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.520
but it's nothing compared
to what I've seen on set.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.440
You've competed
with her so many times...

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.480
Such a shame
you've only realized it now.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.240
Cut!
That was awesome.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
Good job, Rey.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.040
Pong, we've got a problem.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.200
The actress who'll play
the role of Rin's mother

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.200
can't make it to the set.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.880
Man, what the hell?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.440
This is her first scene,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.000
and she happens to be sick?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.240
Even if we found
another actress in her place,

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.400
no one would travel here in time.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.480
Should we cut the scene altogether?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.560
Is this your first day or what?

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.120
This scene is a climax,

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.000
where Rin will be liberated
from being her family's puppet.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.400
Without it,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.200
it's not gonna be "The Doll Mansion."

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.160
Print, do you know

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.560
why I have to be so hard on myself

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.920
and try to be perfect at everything?

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800
Why?

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.320
Because I want to make Mother proud.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.400
Whenever I see her smile

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.200
because of my achievement...

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.920
I feel like

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.400
I can smile

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.200
even wider.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.920
Mother is very proud of me

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.080
that I've become a talented actress

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.440
like she was

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.600
because it's as though...

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.280
I'm fulfilling her dream

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.440
that was lost.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.160
You mother was an actress?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.720
Mm, she was.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.080
She even won an award!

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.000
But...

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.880
because she was pregnant with me,

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.320
she...

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.880
needed to give up on her dream.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.760
Could I propose an idea to you?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.720
What do you think

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.480
about Miss Duen playing a cameo for us?

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.680
She was an award-winning actress.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.120
Though she's been away
from the industry for a while,

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.480
I believe
she's still as talented as ever.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.600
Why would you think that?

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:52.440
Because I know this is what you love,

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.160
and you'll do perfectly at it.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.040
And also,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.680
if the viewers get to witness
the return of such a legendary actress,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160
they will be so thrilled.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.760
Uh... Miss Duen,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.920
if it's not too much to ask,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.280
can you assume the role
of Rin's mother?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.240
If you believe that I'm a proper fit,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.440
there's no reason for me to refuse.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.000
That's superb.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.480
Alright, then.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.920
Come on!

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.080
Someone take Miss Duen
to the dressing room.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.080
You've got this!

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.240
Would you like a sip of ginger tea?

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.600
Maybe it can help you concentrate.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.760
How do you know
it's how I concentrate?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.200
Uh... You see...

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240
Rey once told me

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.480
you like to drink ginger tea
while trying to focus.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.960
Are you nervous, Mother?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.840
Uh...

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960
I mean, "Miss."

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.240
I believe you seem
more nervous than I do.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.960
Yes, I am actually very thrilled

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.240
to see you back on screen.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.040
And I'm certainly grateful

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.760
to see you do what you love
once again, Mother.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.560
Uh... I...

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.920
I'd better leave you alone now, Miss.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.600
I'll...be cheering you on
in front of the monitor.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600
You can do it.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.120
And...action!

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.640
I'm sorry...

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.760
Cut!

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.320
I'm sorry, Pong!

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.560
It's okay, Miss Duen.
We can try again.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.720
Alright.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.240
Mother, hang in there.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.840
I'm sure you got this.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.560
Let's get at it again.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.240
Camera, sound, speed...

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.000
And...action!

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.600
I'm sorry that I have misjudged you.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.720
Mother...

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.200
I now understand

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.960
I couldn't control you
for all the world.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.000
From this day forward,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.800
no matter what your decision might be,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.960
you have my full acceptance.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.280
You and I

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.280
will both finally be freed

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.000
from being this family's puppets.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.600
Cut!

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.040
Magnificent, Miss Duen!

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.440
No wonder you were
an award-winning actress.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.560
Mother, you rock!

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.160
My heart is still racing
from your acting skill.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.360
I haven't thanked you
for the ginger tea.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.680
Thanks.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.320
Alright, guys.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.640
That's a wrap for The Doll Mansion!

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.760
Let's party all night long!

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.800
Good job!

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.720
Fon, are you alright?

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.360
Mai always gets in your way,

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.800
and it annoys me to the core.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.200
Getting in our way...

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.600
You probably didn't notice,

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.120
but her little antics
never escape my sight.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.680
I've seen her trying to separate
you guys non-stop.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.960
I know she's heartless,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.360
but that doesn't mean she needs to force
people to be the same.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.920
Let me ask you this:

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.560
has Mai even really loved anyone?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.240
It seems that way.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.680
- For real?
- Mm!

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.120
She told you that?

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160
Hm...

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.760
She actually did once.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.400
It slipped out of her mouth one day
when she was drunk.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.360
She said she was, like...

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.720
kissing a junior from work

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.600
at their birthday party,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.360
and she felt something
she's never felt for anyone before.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.480
"Kissing a junior from work"?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.800
Mai!

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.440
Do you wanna grab a drink with me?

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.880
Uh...

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.760
I'm not done with work just yet.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.320
Can I text you later tonight?

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.360
Totally.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.080
I can always wait for you.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320
Give me a sec.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.240
You haven't changed a bit,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.680
just like when I worked with you.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.920
You seem really busy.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.000
My plate's a little full lately.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.880
Uh...

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.400
Wanmai,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080
so...

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.560
my slip dress that I forgot,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.920
do you still have it in your office?

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.040
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.080
Hello, Miss Duen.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.600
My name is Note.
I'm a producer.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.080
I believe Pong has told you
about the GL project

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.320
that we'd really like the two girls
to audition for.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.680
Are you interested, ma'am?

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.120
I've known a little about the project.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.840
What do you think about it, Mother?

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:40.360
I should be the one
asking what you think.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.040
I've been thinking about it.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.400
I think...

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.600
Print is more than
a good friend from work.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.920
Since I've found a perfect match

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.560
who knows me so well
as though we're the same person...

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.480
If we go our separate ways
after only working together once,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.800
I'll be so bummed.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.240
I thought so, too.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.320
It would be great
if we could work together again.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.160
Also,

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.600
I can still learn a lot from Rey.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.840
I think it's rather intriguing.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.560
- Please take good care of Rey for me.
- That'd be my pleasure.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.000
I'll be contacting Wanmai and Saifon,

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.800
so the girls can have a chat
with the director.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.720
Okay?

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.760
Okay?

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.800
Goodbye, then.
See you again.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.560
Fon!

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.640
Hm?

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.760
Mai went all the way
to talk to Miss Duen.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.400
That's how she agreed
for us to work together again.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.640
Thank you!

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.960
I could see why you don't drink
during working hours.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.920
But this is after hours...

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.920
Aren't you really gonna drink with me?

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.480
I don't wanna get so drunk that
I spill any more secrets to you again.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.320
Bummer.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.120
Does that mean I'm out of
your spill-the-beans session?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.640
I can always tell you my secret.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.520
No need to get me drunk.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120
Seriously?

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.920
Hm...

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.920
Is something wrong?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.040
Pay her no mind.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720
Now that we're together,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.280
I'd like to spend time with you.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680
I'd like that, too.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040
Hm...

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.440
Should we go to my room,

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.440
your room,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.600
or the seaside to chill?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Mai?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.360
- Mai!
- Yes?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.800
Sorry, were you talking to me?

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.400
You actually didn't want to come with me
in the first place, did you?

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600
Easy, beautiful.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.960
You seem way too drunk.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.240
I'll walk you to your room.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.720
Has Auntie gone to bed?

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.240
Mm.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.400
So...

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.560
should we sneak outside?

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.400
Finally, Auntie Duen caved in!

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.200
Finally, Rey and Print
get to work together again!

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.840
It must be because of your wish, Print.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.480
It's because of you
Auntie opened up.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320
Thanks!

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.360
Look, it's 11:11 P.M.!

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.880
Make a wish!

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.680
I wish for us to share
beautiful moments like this every day!

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.320
Does this mean your dream has come true?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.880
Instantly.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.120
- Mai!
- Hm?

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.640
You carried me back here?

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:04.880
- Fon...
- Uh...

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.680
Let's go.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.120
- Come on.
- Ugh...

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.840
- Nah!
- Let's go back to the room!

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.440
You always pass out when drunk,

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.560
yet you still act tough.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.360
No one's better at kissing girls
than you when drunk.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.480
I really think you should
quit drinking on your own.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.640
Or maybe...

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.520
just stop drinking altogether.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.600
Are you done complaining?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.600
I'm all sobered up because of it.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.640
I'm sorry

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.480
for third wheeling between you
and the girl you like.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.000
But in all honesty...

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.760
you can just go with her.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.960
No need to care about me.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.480
I'm fine passing out at the bar.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.160
How could I do that?

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.520
Now that I'm sober,

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.760
you can just go back to her.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.760
Why are you
always chasing me off to her?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.960
Because she's the one
you're in love with.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.760
You need to be with the girl you love.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.040
Why would you be somewhere else?

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.680
You really want me
to be with the girl I love?

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.640
I'm right
where I'm supposed to be,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.800
then.
