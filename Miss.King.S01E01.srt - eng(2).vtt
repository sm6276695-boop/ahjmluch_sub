And now, the final game of the
Ho-oh title match is here.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.664
A mere step away
from an unprecedented achievement.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.624
Shoichi Yuuki, 9-dan.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.377
Will he win his 100th title?

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.630
The fateful match is about to begin.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.182
It's now the scheduled time.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.351
Ho-oh title match, game seven.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.563
Yuuki 9-dan, to move first. Please begin.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.032
Black, Shoichi Yuuki 9-dan.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.492
Rook to six-eight.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.861
ONE MONTH AGO

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.257
Good morning.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.342
- Good morning!
- Morning.

00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:17.275
ASUKA KUNIMI

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:18.276
Oh! Ms. Kunimi!

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:19.819
Yes?

00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:24.490
You know, we're all going out
for dinner tomorrow.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.367
Why don't you join?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.703
It's a welcome dinner for her.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.085
Sorry. I'm good.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:37.628
Hey, wait…

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.675
"I'm good," she says.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.802
Told you it's not going to happen.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:46.471
Can't pry her open.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.181
I knew it.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:12.663
KEIKO KUNIMI

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.960
As we feared, it has metastasized again.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.550
To be frank, your mother's cancer
is the scirrhous type

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.719
and her condition is serious.

00:06:28.262 --> 00:06:30.723
Her condition may deteriorate
at any moment.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:33.726
I see.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:38.773
Shall I tell her?

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:43.152
I'll tell her myself.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:45.696
Understood.

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.076
Does she have any other family members?

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.211
Family…

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:06.759
No, only me.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.607
THE SECRET TO RANGING ROOKS

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:23.776
SHOGI DICTIONARY

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.037
Come on, Asuka. Don't bother him.

00:07:42.503 --> 00:07:43.880
ROOK

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.842
Asuka. This is your piece.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.553
My piece?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:55.725
I named you after this piece.

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.227
Is it strong?

00:07:58.853 --> 00:07:59.854
Very strong.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.984
Up and down, left and right.
Traveling freely as it wishes.

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.279
It's my favorite piece.

00:08:10.698 --> 00:08:12.992
ROOK

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.791
THE 38TH KIKO TITLE MATCH

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.377
Kunimi 5-dan. Gold to three-one.

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:30.551
I resign.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.471
- Inagaki Kiko has resigned.
- Yes!

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:36.390
- At 135 moves…
- He won, Asuka!

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.975
Is Dad good?

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.478
He's the best!

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:45.441
{\an8}Shoichi Kunimi,
has finally claimed his very first title.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.152
Cheers!

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.946
Congratulations!

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.281
Thank you. It's thanks to you two.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.831
SHOGI

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.756
Here. As a thank you for supporting me.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.216
Yay!

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.802
Asuka, do you like shogi?

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:17.265
Yes! I want to be good.
Good enough to beat you!

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.102
Okay. When you're good enough,
let's have a match.

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:22.186
Promise?

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:23.604
Promise.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.234
All right, next up is The Gods of Shogi.

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.612
Today’s guest is Shoichi Yuuki, 9-dan.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:35.491
- Thank you for coming.
- Hi, I'm Yuuki.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.784
Pleasure to meet you.

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:37.952
You too.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:42.206
Yuuki 9-dan is a living legend
who has set countless records,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.792
and is the driving force
of the recent shogi trend.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:45.918
That's for sure.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:50.965
Next month, you’ll be going for
an unprecedented 100 career titles.

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.800
The whole country's watching you.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:56.929
Your new autobiography,
The End, is already a bestseller too.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.472
THERE IS NO END FOR A KISHI

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.099
It's an intriguing title.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.227
For us kishi,
there's no end to our journey.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:08.190
What counts as the ending, then?
When do we say, "The End"?

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.445
This book is a musing,
searching for that answer.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:15.531
What drives you, Yuuki 9-dan?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.910
Well…

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.456
My family, I'd say.

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:25.041
Ah, your family.

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.795
You talk a lot
about your family in this book, too.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.465
Behind your long, successful career--

00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:48.731
Apparently, many people loved
your TV appearance last night.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.902
I saw you trending online.
Your book is going to sell like crazy.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.945
The royalties will be insane.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.701
By the way, Dad. How was Yuna?

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:02.662
Yuna?

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.622
You met her at the show. The host.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.208
Oh.

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.669
Let me introduce you two.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:12.380
She said she'd like to properly chat.

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:15.091
Shoichi?

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.008
Yeah?

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.763
Next week's meet-and-greet
will be the last promotion event for now.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:22.932
Please see it through.

00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:26.644
Meeting Yuna is important too.

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.396
I'm talking about work.

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:30.356
I'm talking about your future family.

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.502
Aren't you hungry?

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:57.508
Not really.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:01.053
Okay.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.603
Congratulations, Asuka!

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.815
ASUKA KUNIMI
WINNER OF CHILDREN'S SHOGI TOURNAMENT

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.570
Do you think Dad will be happy?

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:18.988
Sure.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.451
I'm good now.
He'll play with me, won't he?

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.286
Maybe.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:27.913
NKK CUP

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.082
Kunimi 7-dan, is in a tight spot.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.877
I resign.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:34.879
Thank you.

00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:40.259
Kunimi 7-dan has resigned.
After 163 moves, Takahashi 5-dan wins.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:46.140
Shoichi Kunimi has lost eight in a row.
He's not had a win this season so far.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.493
Welcome home.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:17.731
ROOK

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.111
Oh Dad! Look!

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.409
See, I'm good now.
I want to play with you.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:33.998
{\an8}ASUKA KUNIMI
WINNER OF CHILDREN'S SHOGI TOURNAMENT

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.333
Dad, you promised…

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.255
Don't touch my shogi set!

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.141
Hey, Asuka!

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:55.936
Oh goodness, are you okay?

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.653
Why don't you take a break?

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:09.283
I would like you to apologize
to Asuka tomorrow.

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:10.910
Leave me alone, will you?

00:15:12.369 --> 00:15:13.662
I must win.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.291
We're your family.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:24.214
I know shogi is important to you
but you need to think about us too.

00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:48.948
LOSING STREAK CONTINUES FOR KUNIMI

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.882
DIVORCE APPLICATION

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.842
What do you get from leaving us?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.890
Do you think you'll win
if you're free of us?

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:20.270
Hey.

00:16:23.107 --> 00:16:24.650
We should try again together.

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:30.280
It'll be okay. You're strong.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.202
Let's win as a family.

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:46.005
Sorry. I don't care anymore…

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:46.922
about you,

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:49.675
or Asuka.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:05.858
You should…

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:08.777
stop playing shogi.

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:24.752
I wasted my move.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.003
At a time like this…

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.348
- Ms. Kunimi!
- Ms. Kunimi?!

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.684
- Mom!
- Ms. Kunimi, are you okay?

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:41.602
Are you okay?

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:48.108
I just had a hard time
hearing the sound of pieces on the board.

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:51.904
It brings back too many memories.

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:55.282
Can you go on your own next time?

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.118
No.

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.621
Now I hate that sound too.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.664
I won't play anymore.

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:19.890
It's okay.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.100
It's okay.

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.863
THERE IS NO END FOR A SHOGI PLAYER

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:25.247
SHOICHI YUUKI

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:50.105
Is it okay for you to walk?

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:55.611
I'm feeling good today,
so I went for a walk.

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:57.529
I see.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:07.956
What's wrong?

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.083
You look down.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.003
Um, I'm not.

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:14.796
You do.

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:16.882
Did something happen?

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:19.259
Well…

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.846
No. Nothing happened.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:36.818
At times like this,
I wish I could take you on a trip.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.029
We'd eat some good food

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.825
and have all the fun we want
until you feel better.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:49.831
That's right.
We should when you feel a bit better.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:53.543
We should.

00:20:55.337 --> 00:20:57.130
Where do you want to go?

00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:00.300
Well…

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:06.848
Oh.

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:09.810
A family restaurant.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.813
A family restaurant?

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:16.858
Remember? We've been to one before.
The three of us.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:30.205
We had such a good time that day.

00:21:37.045 --> 00:21:38.088
Your dad…

00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:46.013
I want to see him.

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:53.520
Why…

00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:56.523
do you want to see him?

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:00.986
Because…

00:22:01.737 --> 00:22:02.863
we're family.

00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:10.495
Family…

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.040
No, only me.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.499
Don't touch my shogi set!

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.752
I don't care anymore

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:17.961
about you,

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:18.879
or Asuka.

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:21.548
What drives you, Yuuki 9-dan?

00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:22.549
Well…

00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:25.552
My family, I'd say.

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:09.304
100,000 COPIES SOLD

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:13.308
- Thank you so much.
- I'm rooting for you.

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:14.726
- I'm supporting you.
- Here.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.644
Thank you.

00:23:19.147 --> 00:23:20.857
He's so popular.

00:23:25.278 --> 00:23:27.739
We need to see your ticket.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.119
Can't I just… Is there any way to get in?

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:35.413
As I said, you need
to have won the lottery to enter.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:38.166
Please, just let me see him for a second.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.626
No way. You can't do that.

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:44.131
My name is Asuka Kunimi.
Could you at least give him my name?

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:46.591
I can't do that. Go away already.

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:47.509
But…

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:49.594
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:51.513
- Please give it a rest.
- Go back inside.

00:23:51.596 --> 00:23:54.224
- Leave, or I'll call the police.
- Well, I…

00:23:55.475 --> 00:23:58.562
I'll take over. You can leave.

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:05.569
I…

00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:08.822
Nice to meet you.

00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:11.908
I'm Kaori Yuuki.

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.494
Shoichi's wife.

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:19.833
What do you need from him?

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:23.420
Oh, my mother wants to see my father…

00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:28.675
I mean, she wants to see Mr. Shoichi.
So I…

00:24:28.758 --> 00:24:30.260
Your mother…

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:33.847
You mean, Ms. Keiko?

00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:35.515
Yes!

00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:39.853
My mom, she's sick. That's why--

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.813
Could you please leave?

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:44.649
What?

00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:49.821
Shoichi is our family.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:55.327
He no longer has anything to do with
either of you.

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:58.580
Oh, but--

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.582
He said so himself.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.545
He doesn't want anything to do with you.

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:12.344
Ah… Wait!

00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:18.141
I'm sorry for showing up like this!

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:21.895
I know I'm causing you trouble, but…

00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:24.648
But…

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.109
My mom is…

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.739
She's dying.

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:34.908
So…

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:36.993
Just this once…

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:44.668
Please! Please let me see my dad!
I need to tell him about her! Please!

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:49.256
I'm so sorry, but…

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.387
Shoichi will never see
either of you again.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.972
Ever.

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:19.995
This is the last time for her! Please!

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.999
Please leave.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.924
Mom.

00:27:39.532 --> 00:27:40.367
Asuka.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.161
Yes?

00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:49.417
I'm sorry.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.671
All this time…

00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:56.716
I've burdened you.

00:28:01.262 --> 00:28:02.097
I'm sorry.

00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:05.225
What?

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.981
It'll be okay now.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.989
Asuka,

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.866
don't be like me.

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.748
Be free and live your life.

00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:09.265
What?

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:16.272
You talk a lot about
your family here, too.

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:08.700
HOW I MET MY WIFE, KAORI

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:10.410
I'm Kaori Yuuki.

00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:12.871
Shoichi's wife.

00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:26.342
He said so himself.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:31.055
He doesn't want anything to do with you.

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:46.279
Shoichi will never see
either of you again.

00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:48.239
Ever.

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.509
I want to see him.

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:10.845
Why…

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:13.806
do you want to see him?

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:16.559
Because…

00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:19.103
we're family.

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.856
What drives you, Yuuki 9-dan?

00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:23.316
Well…

00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:26.319
My family, I'd say.

00:32:31.866 --> 00:32:35.078
TO MY BELOVED FAMILY:
MY WIFE KAORI AND MY SON TATSUYA

00:32:35.161 --> 00:32:36.871
I don't care anymore…

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:38.748
about you,

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.209
or Asuka.

00:32:54.722 --> 00:32:58.893
TO MY BELOVED FAMILY:
MY WIFE KAORI AND MY SON TATSUYA

00:32:58.977 --> 00:32:59.852
Why?

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:05.233
For a bastard like this…

00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:53.239
We can feel the tension from here.

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:56.075
They're fired up.

00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:03.458
These two have played
countless legendary matches.

00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:07.462
And now, the final game of the
Ho-oh title match is here.

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:10.173
Just one step away from
an unprecedented achievement.

00:34:10.673 --> 00:34:12.133
Shoichi Yuuki, 9-dan.

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:14.510
Will he win his 100th title?

00:34:15.803 --> 00:34:18.014
The fateful match is about to begin.

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:33.613
YUUKI 9-DAN VS. SASAMA HO-OH
THE 64TH HO-OH TITLE MATCH GAME SEVEN

00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:37.116
Black, Shoichi Yuuki 9-dan.
Rook to six-eight.

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:39.160
So, it has begun.

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:41.996
A typical opening for Yuuki 9-dan,
wouldn't you say?

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:46.709
Definitely. Like a declaration that
he'll fight head-on.

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.631
Sasama Ho-oh, pawn to three-four.

00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.183
What are you doing?

00:35:58.114 --> 00:36:01.617
This is alarming. Who are you?

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.246
Who are you targeting with this?

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.294
Shoichi Yuuki.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:14.964
Why?

00:36:19.635 --> 00:36:21.554
Have you ever stabbed a person before?

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.435
Something like this can't kill him.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.981
I'll stab him repeatedly.

00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:37.361
Drop it. It's meaningless.

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:47.747
You know what? Me too.

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.960
I also want to kill Shoichi Yuuki.

00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:03.971
But, no matter how much you
stab him with this,

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.933
you wouldn't be able to kill him.

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.961
Yuuki 9-dan is on the defensive now.

00:37:35.544 --> 00:37:37.713
He's getting locked down.

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.466
It's looking pretty tough.

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:43.803
How will Yuuki 9-dan
respond to this situation?

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:48.474
Unfortunately, he's a superstar now.

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:51.185
Sasama Ho-oh is…

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.562
Know what happens
if a star dies at their peak?

00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:56.691
They become deified.

00:37:58.276 --> 00:38:01.821
Worshipped like a deity.
They'd end up living forever.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.701
So, stabbing him now would be pointless.

00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:13.958
There’s only one way to kill him.

00:38:17.336 --> 00:38:18.170
That.

00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:32.476
My family, I'd say.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.730
I don't care anymore, about you or Asuka.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:46.073
That man is not a superstar.

00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:47.742
What?

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.952
He's just a piece of shit.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:04.091
What's Yuuki 9-dan's next move?

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:06.886
To defend, or to attack?

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:14.894
It's rare for him
to take so long to make a move.

00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:40.920
Oh! He's moving.

00:40:43.023 --> 00:40:45.443
ROOK

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:19.226
I resign.

00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:31.155
Wow.

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:37.119
- Hey, this…
- Yuuki 9-dan has done it!

00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.330
He is the first
to reach 100 career titles!

00:41:39.413 --> 00:41:41.207
Unbelievable!

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.375
I've got goosebumps!

00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:46.754
That was a perfect
Shoichi Yuuki style victory.

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.632
- Right.
- A historic match, no doubt!

00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:51.717
In the middle of the game,

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.928
Sasama Ho-oh seemed to
have the upper hand…

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:04.230
So she can kill him…

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:33.050
Let's team up, Asuka Kunimi.

00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:35.010
I'm going to kill the old era.

00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:36.178
What?!

00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:40.266
You have to be the
very first female kishi ever.

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.892
Women can only go so far.

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:45.271
We never know if we will win or lose.

00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:47.648
I'll become a kishi
and beat Shoichi Yuuki.

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:50.568
To kill someone
is to deny their entire life.

00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.528
For him, that's shogi.

00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:58.784
Don't keep fighting a losing game.

00:42:58.867 --> 00:42:59.952
It's hard to watch.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:04.748
We're banned. They're pressuring us.

00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.292
I'll destroy you tomorrow.

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.251
Leave.

00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:09.878
I told you. It's all games.

00:43:09.962 --> 00:43:11.171
I'm sorry.

00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:16.176
Take this. My condolences.

00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:24.268
I'll kill you with shogi.

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:27.855
{\an8}Well, let's begin.

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.690
