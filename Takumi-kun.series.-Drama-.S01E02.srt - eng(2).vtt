00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.470
Far from the noise of the city...

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.270
nestled on a mountainside...

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.230
an all-boys boarding school...

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.010
Shido Gakuin High School.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.190
It was here that I met the person

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.500
who would change my destiny forever.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.070
Saki Giichi.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.160
Known as Gii.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.460
Gii was born in the U.S.
and came back to Japan.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.260
He's the heir to a fortune,
always in the spotlight,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660
and the heart of Shido Gakuin.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.060
To me...

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.180
he was my polar opposite,

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340
a person from another world.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.710
And yet...

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.890
I love you, Takumi.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.540
Gii.

"Takumi-kun series -Drama-"
(Episode 2)

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.100
During Golden Week,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.630
most students went
home for the long holiday

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.330
or took trips.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.410
One, two, three, four.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.760
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:37.040
The only students left at Shido

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.330
were the athletes training for
the summer nationals... and...

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.050
the ones busy with student council,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.490
like him.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.850
Five, six, seven, eight...

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.060
Hey, sports clubs!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.260
Can anyone help organize the storage room?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.750
Arata-san! I'll help!

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.580
You again?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.820
It's tough work. You okay with that?

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.570
Of course.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.970
It's what I'm best at.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.030
Leave it to me.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.670
And then...

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.886
(Astronomy Club)
As for the culture clubs,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.150
those with presentations coming up...

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.510
- were also swamped with preparations.
- Takabayashi-kun.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.790
Let me get that.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.070
No, thank you.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.060
I can manage on my own.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.636
It's just to the exhibition hall, right?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.270
It's on my way.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.060
Hey, Yoshizawa.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.580
Can you carry these for me too?

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.010
Perfect.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.876
Yoshizawa says he'll carry
everything for you guys.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.110
Hey, Yamashita.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.020
Don't worry about it.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.040
Yeah, I'll carry them over.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.320
We're counting on you.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.290
Here we go...

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.320
Okay, you should get to your club practice.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.760
Got it.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.650
Okay then.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.590
I'm heading out.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.290
You guys go on ahead.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.850
Yes.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.840
Hey, Takabayashi.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.830
You're not acting like yourself today.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.170
You abandoned your personal guard.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.260
It wasn't because of him, was it?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.230
What?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.340
Of course not.

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:23.020
Morning, Captain Kado.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.340
Yoshizawa.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.500
Tell everyone to start without me.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.650
Yes, sir.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.560
You've got a good eye, Itami.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.490
Noticing our beautiful 'actress'.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000
Beautiful... what?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.130
Schauspielerin.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.370
It's what we third-years call him.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.219
It's German for 'actress'.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.250
Just take it.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.470
So, who is he?

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.620
Takabayashi Izumi.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.620
- A second-year in the Astronomy Club.
- There's still some left.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.140
Then hurry up and bring it over.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.670
As for me...

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.850
During the holiday,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.590
I tried going home for a bit.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.030
But the awkward
conversations with my parents...

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.380
and the feeling of not belonging in
my own house just wouldn't go away.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.490
Before I knew it,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.060
I was spending my days

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:28.052
just wandering around outside.

00:05:30.136 --> 00:05:31.405
And with Gii...

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.240
Because...

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.600
- Being misunderstood is the worst.
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.680
I'm in love with you, Takumi.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.450
What guy in the world...

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.090
wouldn't be moved by the person he loves?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.130
I'm sorry... Gii.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.080
If all you can do is apologize...

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.110
Takumi...

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.650
Gii?!

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.540
I love you,

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.970
Takumi.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.220
Stop! Gii!

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.130
Things were left awkward between us.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.510
Gii went to New York on family business.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.830
We...

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.380
parted ways just like that.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.390
(What are you up to?)

00:06:30.552 --> 00:06:34.262
(Nothing special.)

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.200
(Can I call?)

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.970
(Yeah.)

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.210
Takumi?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840
Gii...

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.810
Hey, how are you?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.700
I'm doing fine.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.950
What about you, Gii?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.800
You're in New York now,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.870
right?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080
Yeah.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.206
What time is it over there?

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.230
Um...

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.830
9 a.m.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.150
Huh, wait.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.660
What about where you are?

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.210
The time difference is 13 hours, so...

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.530
It's 7 p.m.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.980
Wait... yesterday?

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.210
Yeah, I'm a day behind you.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.830
I see.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.670
That feels so strange.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.950
Hey, Takumi.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.160
Want to meet up in a bit?

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.020
Huh?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.240
But, Gii, you're in New York.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.410
I finished up my business.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.500
I'm on my way to catch a flight to Haneda.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.310
I'll see you in 14 hours.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.120
This is so sudden...

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.650
I see.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.490
You don't want to see me?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.650
That's not it.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.890
It's just...

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.460
Uh, well...

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.550
There's stuff going on at home...

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.190
and a lot of other things.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.830
So...

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.210
It's fine.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.410
It's fine, I understand.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.126
We'll be seeing each other at
school soon enough anyway.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.350
I was getting ahead of myself.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.670
Sorry, Takumi.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.770
But...

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.670
It's okay for me to call, right?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.770
I've been trying so hard to resist.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.160
At least forgive me for this.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.590
You're finally smiling.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.160
Huh?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.620
Last time...

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.910
we parted on such a bad note.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.080
And when you left for home,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.760
you looked so upset.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.080
I was worried about you.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.670
So that's why.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.430
I'm all right.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
I'm doing fine.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.910
I see.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.750
Then I'll call you again tomorrow.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.330
Okay.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.030
Okay, talk to you tomorrow.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.000
Gii is so perceptive.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920
Looking back,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.920
he was like that when
I first started here, too.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.160
Hayama, you're really bad at
expressing yourself, aren't you?

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.290
Huh?

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.650
Or maybe...

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.120
it's 'human-contact-phobia.'

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.740
Human-contact...

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.350
phobia?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.490
A diagnosis I just came up with.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.010
Pretty fitting, don't you think?

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.070
I'm not good with people.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.080
He didn't see me, the odd one out,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.030
as a freak.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.550
Instead, he said I was
bad at expressing myself.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.990
He was the only one who got it right.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.530
Sorry.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.630
I just wanted to talk with you
a little more before I take off.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.570
Am I bothering you?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.140
What is it? You're smiling.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.430
Because...

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320
Hey, Takumi.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320
Yeah?

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.130
Next time, let's go on a date.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.200
A... A date?

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.430
I want to see you somewhere

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.790
other than school.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.750
But, where would we go?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.060
Where do you want to go?

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.460
As long as I'm with you, Gii,

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.780
anywhere is fine.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.020
Anywhere, huh...

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.780
- Someday...
- I promise I'll take you anywhere you want to go.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.490
Yeah.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.200
Let's definitely go on that date.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.430
Gii.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.060
Arata-san.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.750
Arata-san, can...

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.590
Can we take a break?

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.290
After we finish out here,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.860
we still have the inside to clean.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.020
Wait...

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.000
I know, but...

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.980
I just want to... rest for a bit.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.870
Giving up already?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.100
No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.530
It's not that, I'm just...

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840
a little...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.470
tired.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.470
Ow...

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.950
I feel alive again...

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.090
Are you being that dramatic?

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.430
It is that tiring.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.570
Look, my hands are shaking.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.380
Thanks to you, it's been
a lot easier on my end.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.660
Really?

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.970
Me?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.500
If it means helping you, Arata-san,

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.250
I'll do anything.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.310
Too close.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.550
Don't invade my personal space.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840
Sorry.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200
I...

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.270
I like you so much, Arata-san.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.550
You know...

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.049
Always saying you like me.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.190
Isn't it time you dropped the act?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.440
I'm not joking.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.540
I'm serious.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.400
I...

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.400
Ever since the first time I saw you...

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.570
on the day of the Shido entrance exam.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.190
I was...

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.830
so nervous the night
before, I couldn't sleep at all.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.540
During the test,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.070
I was incredibly tense.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.800
My mind was a complete blur.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.480
We were told at the beginning
not to pick up anything we dropped.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.230
I'm sorry.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.570
I was being reported.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.530
I thought to myself,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.410
I'm definitely...

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.700
going to be disqualified.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.420
All right, please pass your
answer sheets to the front.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.460
Number 135, Shingyoji-kun.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.949
If you're not feeling well,

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.590
you may go to the nurse's office now.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040
Huh?

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.910
That person...

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.900
He didn't report me.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800
And then...

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.600
after the test was over,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.850
What's with you, Misu?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.060
Same old Misu.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.780
You think so?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.520
For the first time...

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.890
at the very moment I fell in love,

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:40.990
I realized...

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.770
it was my first love.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.790
- Well, these things happen.
- Um...

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680
Um...

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.060
- Um...
- What is it?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.550
Misu, do you two know each other?

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.230
Who knows.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.050
Um... um...

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.080
Um... Excuse me...

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.450
Um... Excuse me...

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.690
Are you Arata Misu...

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.980
right?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.260
Um...

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.590
Th-the...

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.060
The... the kanji for it...

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.220
How do you write it?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.010
Why the sudden question?

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.230
Um...

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.950
Go on and tell him, Misu.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.390
We'll go on ahead.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.520
Uh...

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.900
I... I...

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.540
I... I... I...

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.890
I...

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.741
My name is Shingyoji Kanemitsu.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.480
Um...

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.870
- The kanji is...
- I didn't ask for your name.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.470
Please.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.100
Please tell me.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.309
Please! Please! Please!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.180
Please! Please! Please!

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.769
Please! Please! Please!

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.150
All right! I get it!

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.020
The 'Mi' for the number
three, and 'su' for sandbar.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.550
Together, it's Misu.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.730
Huh?

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.750
As for my first name...

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.930
If you get into our school,
I'll tell you then.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.280
So then...

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.150
The number three...

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.160
And the word for sandbar...

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.650
Misu.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.750
Misu.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:17.370
Misu.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.030
(Entrance Ceremony)
I successfully got into this school.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.610
Arata Misu!

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.540
Arata Misu, I... I got in!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.940
As promised...

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.746
He told me his first name is 'Arata, '
written with the character for 'new'.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.850
Arata.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.520
Even though I told you,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.690
I never gave you permission
to call me by my first name.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:55.750
To me,

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.140
the name "Arata-san"

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.070
is my treasure.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.450
Say whatever you want.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.530
I've liked you ever since then.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.450
- Arata-san!
- You're so loud.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.520
Rejected.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.410
Break's over.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.490
I have student council business.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.730
I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.950
Yes, sir.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720
Yoshizawa.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.140
Is your form a little off?

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.440
Did you hurt your back?

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.540
It feels like you're
subconsciously protecting it.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.010
Hitting the bullseye every time even
when you're not at your best. How annoying.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.130
You're a shoo-in for the
summer tournament team.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.769
No, there are only five spots.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.360
Plus, there are so many upperclassmen.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.960
Then I have even less of a chance.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.950
Hey, Yoshizawa.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.070
Come here for a second.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.030
Yes.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.620
Hey, you're roommates
with Takabayashi Izumi, right?

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.390
Ah...

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.530
Yes.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:34.810
Yes... we are roommates.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.370
Is he seeing anyone?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.690
Even though we're roommates,

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.590
I don't know anything
about his private life.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.030
Sorry about this morning.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.530
Is your back okay?

00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:12.782
Yeah, it's fine.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.430
It's no big deal.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.230
Hey.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.350
Yoshizawa.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.110
Do you hate me?

00:20:32.749 --> 00:20:33.949
That's not it at all.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.910
No.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.050
I see.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.900
That's good.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.450
But...

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.000
Takabayashi-kun.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.110
I know that you like Saki-kun.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.320
You're an exceptional person.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.880
Saki-kun must also...

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.720
Why are you bringing up
something from so long ago?

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.090
I'm not going to apologize.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.830
You idiot, Yoshizawa.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720
And then...

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.990
on the last day of Golden Week,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.370
Welcome back, Takumi.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.410
I'm back, Gii.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.890
Thanks.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.340
However...

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.030
the joy of our reunion was short-lived.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.750
Hayama, you're studying hard.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.459
These midterms...

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.690
I'm so screwed.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.100
Especially English.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.086
If it's English, you should
just have Gii teach you.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.270
Right, Gii?

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.480
Anything my dear Takumi asks,

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.820
anytime at all.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.760
- That's a little creepy.
- Huh? Sorry.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.779
Nozaki.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.090
You still haven't given up on that guy?

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.290
He's a tough nut to crack, you know.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.030
No problem.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.070
I just need to get him
to go out with me once.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.510
Winning him over will be a piece of cake.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.710
I'll get Hayama, even
if I have to play rough.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.810
Well, you're certainly confident.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.010
You're back, Gii.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.150
Oh, they posted the
topics for the midterms.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:20.770
Here.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.370
Thanks.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.510
Gii.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.620
What's wrong?

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.390
Takumi.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.530
I love you.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.800
I know.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.810
I've heard that plenty of times.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Takumi.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.470
What about you?

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:46.750
Huh?

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.190
Gii, what's been up with you?

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.520
Do you love me?

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.170
It was my fault.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.500
Just forget what I said.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.160
Gii always tells me he loves me.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.160
For him to say something like that...

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.010
Is it because of me?

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.170
Well, well.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.970
We meet again.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.410
What is it?

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.580
Don't be so cold.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.390
If that's all...

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.030
I'll be on my way.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.140
That roommate of yours...

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.770
He's got a thing for you, doesn't he?

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.560
He's a player.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.600
You'd better be careful.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.196
Did you come all this
way just to tell me that?

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.220
No.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.210
This time, I'm going to...

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.870
- ask you out.
- No.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.720
Don't be like that.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.790
I'm liking you more and more.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.940
The defiant way you stand up to me...

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.670
It's almost as if...

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.220
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.490
Hayama?

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.960
Don't be so afraid.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.740
Excuse me.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:03.650
During the lunch break,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.480
what were you and Nozaki talking about?

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.450
That's none of your business,

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.580
Akaike-kun.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.750
Yes, it is.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.190
Frankly, it's becoming a problem.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.330
Huh...?

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.540
You really are...

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.949
You don't understand a thing.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.700
All you do is make Gii worry.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.570
And you still call yourself his friend?

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:21.940
You're so hopelessly naive.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.589
Akaike-kun, are you trying to pick a fight?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.140
Nozaki's the one who started it.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.570
No.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.110
When it comes down to it, it was Gii.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.070
What's that supposed to mean?

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.240
Gii made a bet with Nozaki.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.350
The bet was about you, Hayama Takumi.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.060
What?

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.590
A bet?

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.740
Gii made a bet with Nozaki... about me?

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.910
What in the world does that mean?
