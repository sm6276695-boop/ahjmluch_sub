00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
(Episode 6)

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.879
I called you all day yesterday.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
You didn't pick up.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.120
I came,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.240
but you were in the infirmary.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.519
They're going to sue me...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.559
for hitting Han Kui Long's son...

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560
and fleeing the scene.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.280
What should we do now?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.600
Did you go to the Old City District?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.080
Did you find that white Mercedes?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800
I went there.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.040
But they burned the car last night.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.840
What about Xiao Bei?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.680
Did you talk to him?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.240
I couldn't find him.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.400
He's probably hiding
because he's too scared.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
The police...

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.800
might charge you with a hit-and-run.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.079
So if you have any evidence...

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.560
that can help yourself,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.400
stop hiding it.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920
Can I turn state's evidence?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.360
I don't know what you're afraid of.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.879
But if you can provide clues
to solve the case...

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.440
and make a deal
with the prosecution,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.719
I can help you apply
for special protection.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.760
They can't protect me here.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.720
Unless I can leave.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.120
My whole family
has to leave with me.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.120
As long as I'm in Hokong,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.680
I can't say anything.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320
Luo Wen.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.640
I just met with Ma Shan Bao.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.120
He wants to make a deal
with the prosecution.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040
Does he plan to admit
to stealing the car?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.920
He wants to turn state's evidence.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.616
Who does he want to testify against?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.999
As long as he and his family...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
get enough protection,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
he'll tell the truth.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760
What truth?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680
He'll reveal...

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.440
the real culprit who hit Han Gang.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200
So that means...

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.840
he didn't tell you
who the culprit is.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.000
Ma Shan Bao
is very scared right now.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.880
He doesn't trust anyone,
including me.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.920
Then why do you believe...

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.640
someone who doesn't trust you?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.040
That's because I have faith
in Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.239
I know the person
he's going to name...

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.799
must be someone important
that no one dares to touch.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.920
That's why he's so scared.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
Qi Chang Rong?

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640
I don't know.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.640
But if it's him,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.880
Who is the presiding officer?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.400
Prosecutor Zhang Song Shan.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.040
Zhang Song Shan?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.120
Zhang Song Shan
is from the Old City District.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
This...

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.120
will be his weakness.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.880
So you're saying...

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.720
People of the Old City District...

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.776
have always been unwilling
to cooperate with the police.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.879
When have you ever seen...

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.919
someone
from the Old City District...

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.280
turn state's evidence?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.840
Make an outrageous demand.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.360
Tell him...

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.399
he has to pay three years'
worth of living expenses...

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
for his family.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.080
He has to help
Ma Shan Bao immigrate...

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720
to Canada.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.280
Will Mr. Zhang
accept these conditions?

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.840
What does this have
to do with the Old City District?

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.640
Only if you ask
for something outrageous...

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840
will he believe...

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.639
that there's really
someone powerful behind you.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.920
Then, he'll think it's worth it.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640
If Zhang Song Shan...

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.680
really becomes
the prosecutor for this case,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.199
he'll want to make a big splash...

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.120
to tell the world
that the Old City District...

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.840
can also produce a good prosecutor.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.240
But will Mr. Zhang...

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.280
believe a rookie like me?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.120
It's precisely because a rookie
dares to make such an offer...

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.120
that he'll believe in its value.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.840
So my next step...

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.680
is to make Mr. Zhang believe...

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.040
that for Ma Shan Bao
to tell the truth,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.240
he must accept his conditions.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.040
This is a golden opportunity.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.640
It's also the only way
to help Ma Shan Bao.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.560
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.320
Hey, hurry up.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480
Hurry up!

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040
Stop for a moment.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.280
Wei.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.680
Is this how you welcome
your good buddy?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760
Madam.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360
Ms. Zhou is here.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080
Have a seat.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.320
Didn't you insist...

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.520
that your client
wasn't present at the scene?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.480
Has Mr. Zhang arrived?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.360
Didn't we agree to meet at 11am?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.439
Mr. Zhang just called.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.400
He said there's a traffic jam
near the courthouse.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.040
You used to be a detective captain.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.120
Now you've stooped so low
as to smuggle parallel imports...

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.080
to support your family of four.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.240
Stop beating around the bush.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.000
How much can you make
with goods like these?

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.760
Not as much as you make
from murder and arson.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080
That's right.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280
In that case,

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:39.160
200,000 HKD is clearly not
a small amount to you.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.360
Coming up with such a large sum
of money at once...

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.920
must not have been easy, right?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.560
Bao calls you Uncle.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.400
Sha Sha and her mom
are like sisters.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.200
This matter was supposed to be
your family's business.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.040
But now, Da Xiong...

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440
was splashed with hot oil.

00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:59.680
He's living in torment.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.640
I'm their boss.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.759
I have to come out...

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.240
to get justice for my men.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.480
Now that Han Gang is in a coma,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.760
and Da Xiong is injured,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.719
it's only a matter of time...

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.160
before I go to war
with Han Kui Long.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.840
But we're in such a mess now...

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.760
all because of Bao.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.360
I asked his mom.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.280
You called Bao out that night.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.200
Tell me.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.440
Why did you call him out?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.960
Where did you get the 200,000 HKD?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.240
Who are you covering for?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040
You won't tell me?

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.080
You don't have to tell me.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.120
You're certainly involved in this.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680
What do you want?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.560
It's simple.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.879
To take down Han Kui Long,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.040
we need more than a few men
and some guns.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.919
We need some big weapons...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.320
to guarantee a victory.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.680
For Sha Sha and the kids' sake,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.400
do it for me.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.760
It's for your own sake too.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.160
Be sensible.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.120
Mr. Zhang, please come in.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200
- Mr. Zhang.
- Mr. Zhang.

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.839
I'm sorry. I had a lot of cases
this morning.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840
There was also traffic just now.

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:39.881
- It's okay.
- Have a seat.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.600
You're Ms. Zhou Wen Luo, right?

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920
Please speak.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640
It's Zhou Luo Wen.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.120
Okay, Ms. Zhou.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.240
Let's save time
and get to the point.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
My client...

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.200
wants to make a deal.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.200
So he's willing to plead guilty?

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.880
He wants to turn state's evidence.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.760
But he's the only defendant
in the entire case.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.239
The police have
no direct evidence...

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.919
to prove that my client
stole the car...

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.400
and caused the accident.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.480
As there is a reasonable doubt,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.080
the court may favor
the presumption of innocence.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.959
But if my client...

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.840
is willing to tell the truth
about the accident,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.959
we can save judicial resources.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.599
It's beneficial for both parties.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.919
You kept insisting...

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.360
that Ma Shan Bao
wasn't at the scene.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.719
Now, all of a sudden,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.040
you're saying he knows the truth.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.400
What is the meaning of that?

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.640
I can reveal a bit more.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880
This accident...

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.920
might not have been an accident.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.520
Do you mean...

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.160
it was an intentional assault?

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.480
I'm not ruling out that possibility.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.079
This is my client's request.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.159
If you agree,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.160
he will talk.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.760
Canada?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.199
And his whole family has to go?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.760
We have to give him
living expenses too.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.399
Qi Chang Rong's power...

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.360
has long been entrenched
in the Old City District.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.640
No one there has ever dared
to turn state's evidence.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.479
That's because
not cooperating with the police...

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.679
is their tradition.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680
Inspector Tang
should know that very well.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.520
He's just a car thief.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
What would he know?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.279
Ma Shan Bao grew up
in the Old City District.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.680
He's one of Qi Chang Rong's men.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480
I'm sorry.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280
Ms. Zhou, right?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.920
From the sound of it,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.200
you seem to know
the Old City District very well.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.239
Then do you know...

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.239
how to differentiate
between the district's residents...

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240
and Qi Chang Rong's men?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.679
This case...

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.560
is your first solo case, right?

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.480
I admire your courage.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.200
But you can't be so greedy, okay?

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.159
So you're questioning my ability...

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.200
because I'm inexperienced.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.600
As a lawyer, you can't be so hasty.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.479
If you ask for too much,
it could suffocate you.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.359
Mr. Zhang, you're from
the Old City District too.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360
- What?
- Don't you...

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640
What did you say?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.440
Who said
I'm from the Old City District?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560
You're not?

00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:11.920
Mr. Zhang grew up abroad.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.720
He only returned after graduating.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.280
My identity shouldn't be
part of the negotiation.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.520
I don't think we need
to continue this conversation.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.560
Ms. Zhou Luo Wen, right?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.800
I'm sorry.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.480
I'll see her out first.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.240
Hello. Did it go smoothly?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040
I'm doomed.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.080
Mr. Zhang isn't
from the Old City District at all.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.440
That's not right.
You've seen his profile.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.640
Both of his parents
are from the Old City District.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.880
What happened?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.680
He's very sensitive
to the words "Old City District".

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.400
He wouldn't let me continue.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.400
Don't worry. There must be a way.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.320
Old City District?

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.159
You have no idea how many years...

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.400
it took me to shed that label.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.120
Mr. Zhang, don't mind the rookie.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.279
He wants to turn state's evidence...

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.999
and have his whole family
immigrate abroad.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.079
What makes him so confident...

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.200
to propose such conditions?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.656
Let's indict him
according to the original charges.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680
Mr. Zhang.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.560
Please take a look
at this report first.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760
What is this?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200
It's a DNA report...

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200
from the crime scene.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.880
You're only showing it to me now?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.680
I just received it too.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.216
I was going to give it to you
as soon as you got here.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.279
I didn't expect Ms. Zhou...

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.280
to arrive so early.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The report shows...

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.560
that there are two DNA samples...

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800
that are identical.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.839
One is from the vomit on the ground.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840
The other one...

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.040
is from the asthma inhaler.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.400
I believe it belongs
to the real culprit.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.759
He must have been too nervous
when he committed the crime,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.520
- causing him to vomit.
- Wait.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.680
It doesn't match Ma Shan Bao's DNA.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.080
I think we really have
the wrong person.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680
And the police...

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.281
have no reason
to continue detaining him.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.040
His lawyer...

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.840
doesn't know about this report yet.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.320
Only we know.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.760
He even made fun of me...

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.359
in front of Inspector Tang
for being greedy.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.040
He was absolutely
flaunting his experience.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.239
Crushing your confidence...

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.640
is their usual tactic.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.560
Did you offer any conditions?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880
Did they respond?

00:15:35.881 --> 00:15:36.920
What's their bottom line?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640
He didn't say.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.400
Mr. Zhang directly refused.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.520
That means Ma Shan Bao
will continue to be detained.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280
Wait.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.360
Inspector Tang just texted me.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.256
She asked me to go back
and continue the discussion.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
Did you ask her why?

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040
No.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040
Remember.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.960
Either they agree to all conditions,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.016
or there'll be no discussion.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.200
Stand your ground.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880
Understood.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680
Ms. Zhou.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.400
You did get
a bit off-topic just now.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.039
But luckily, Mr. Zhang
is a reasonable man.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.920
He's willing to give your client
another chance.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120
I understand.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.400
I'm sorry about just now.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800
It's fine.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.280
Ma Shan Bao's demands
can be discussed.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.160
But there's a prerequisite.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.800
I must know...

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.480
how credible the so-called truth
he plans to reveal is.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.600
Who was behind
the intentional assault?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.400
Because he never mentioned it.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.199
I need my client's consent...

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.240
before I can answer you.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.160
You can call him now.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.560
I have my own phone.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.480
What do you think?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.159
I'm sure someone behind her...

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.480
taught her what to do.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.919
It's not something
a newbie like her...

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.040
would pull off.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.559
Then let's see how capable she is...

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.880
and what she can do.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600
How did it go?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.440
They want to know
who the real culprit is.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.560
This is your trump card.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.800
If you reveal it too soon,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.120
you'll have no bargaining chips.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.800
Tell them...

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.800
that your client refuses.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Copy that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.120
My client...

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480
refuses.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.479
If you let me see him
in the detention center,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.760
I can make him agree.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.680
I'll give you one day.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.800
Let's talk here tomorrow
at the same time.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.800
I have one more request.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040
What now?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.599
I will apply to the court...

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.000
for my client to go home...

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.880
under police house arrest.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.120
You said it's dangerous outside,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.176
but it's not safe
in the detention center either.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.759
My client wants to go home...

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.800
and see his family.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.599
I need to fulfill his request...

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.280
to convince him.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960
At the same time,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.560
I need Mr. Zhang...

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.280
to support my application
to the court.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.439
I'll go back and prepare...

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.600
the documents for the court.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760
Thank you both.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.200
This is our only chance
to find the real culprit...

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.040
and stop the two gangs
from fighting.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.360
If you don't mind, Mr. Zhang...

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.840
I don't mind.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.680
Just follow the procedure.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720
Okay.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.520
Isn't class over?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520
Why are you back?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.000
Can I have a word with you?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.639
Psychological counseling can...

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.000
They can't help me.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
I'm sorry.

00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:55.760
I really can't help you either.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Coach.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.040
I know the drinking incident...

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200
got you into trouble.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.720
But I'm really grateful...

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.640
that you were there for me.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:11.360
This is for you.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880
Take it as my apology.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.280
It's okay.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.960
Just take care of yourself.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.880
Hey. Qin Yi Wei!

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.120
Qi Chang Rong found out
I gave money to Bao's family,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.000
so he's blaming it on me.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.160
He even threatened me
with my wife and kids...

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.480
to help him
steal a batch of weapons.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.880
You didn't agree, did you?

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.640
Do I have a choice?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.480
Is there really no other way?

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.720
We have a bigger problem now.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.000
Bao is going
to turn state's evidence.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.000
Who told you that?

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.680
Ms. Zhou said that
Bao hasn't said anything yet.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.640
Once he opens his mouth,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160
he'll expose you and me.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.240
You have one night...

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.120
to convince Bao to change his mind.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.040
Bao is in solitary now.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.799
I can't even see him.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800
How can I convince him?

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.800
He'll be released soon.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.640
He'll be under house arrest.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.119
The prosecution and the court...

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120
are on board with it.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480
Tonight...

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
is the last chance.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.160
I'll go back and discuss it
with my wife first.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.080
We're already in trouble.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.680
Don't drag her into this.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.960
What should I do then?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.680
If you really find him,

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200
tell him...

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720
that the police...

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.880
don't have much evidence.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.919
As long as he makes it through this,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920
I'll think of a solution.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.840
Tell him to tell Ms. Zhou...

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.600
that he has changed his mind...

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.280
and insists on staying silent.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080
Ultimately,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.160
you're just afraid
something will happen to you.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.920
I have nothing to be afraid of.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.520
I just don't want
to give up on Yi Wei.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Even if the police come
knocking on our door,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.400
they won't take Yi Wei away.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.160
I won't let him go to jail.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.160
You're just going to run away?

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.720
Is this how you treat your friend?

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120
If I didn't see you as a friend,

00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:30.761
I wouldn't have asked you
to look for Bao.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.720
I'm helping you and all of us.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.440
Whether we run away or not...

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.480
depends on whether
you can shut Bao up.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.400
You can go home tonight.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120
Really?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.200
You'll be under house arrest.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.480
But at least you can go home...

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.680
and see your mom and siblings.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.120
What's their condition?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.080
Tell them who the real culprit is.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800
Then...

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.160
What about my demands?

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560
What about the money?

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.280
Where will my family go?

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.719
Telling them
who the real culprit is...

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.760
is a prerequisite.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.839
The truth has to be convincing...

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.840
for them to allow you
to turn state's evidence.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240
How about this?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.320
I'll let you sleep on it.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760
When you get home,

00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:34.280
you can discuss it with your mom.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920
Can I...

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.440
really go home tonight?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.360
But the deadline...

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.080
is 9am tomorrow.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.240
You must tell them
the real culprit's name.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.640
Otherwise,
they'll bring you back right away.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.840
There will be
no State's Evidence Program...

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.200
because they will think
you can't be trusted.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520
- Mom!
- Mom!

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.336
- Shan Bao is back!
- Shan Bao is back!

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360
Shan Bao is back.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.919
Shan Bao is back.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.560
- Look, Shan Bao is back!
- It's Shan Bao!

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.200
Shan Bao is back!

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.839
Can you uncuff him now?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.280
Don't let his siblings
see the cuffs.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.880
- It's Shan Bao.
- Uncuff him.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.280
You can count on me to keep my word.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.960
I hope you'll keep your promise too.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.440
Shan Bao is back!

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.880
- Bao.
- Shan Bao!

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040
- I'm back!
- Shan Bao!

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.320
You're back.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.079
- Shan Bao is back!
- Mom, I'm home.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080
This is great!

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.640
Did you miss me, sis?

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680
Shan Bao!

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.320
- Come on, give him a hug.
- Shan Bao!

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.520
You've gotten heavier again.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.079
We're so happy, Shan Bao.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.136
- Let's go inside.
- You're home now.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160
Shan Bao!

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.199
Shan Bao, it's good
to have you back.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.400
- Did you miss me?
- We're glad you're home, Shan Bao.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.960
Dad.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Hey.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.720
Why can't I find your passport?

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.360
What are you doing?

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.920
I'm buying plane tickets.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.680
What's going on?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.240
- Fly!
- It's time to eat!

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.760
Fly again!

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.640
Bao, it's time to eat.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.639
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.440
- Let's eat.
- Come on. Hurry up and eat.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640
Thank you, Mom.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120
Shan Bao.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.160
Come on, Bao.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.199
- Eat more.
- Shan Bao, eat.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.359
- Eat up, Shan Bao.
- All right.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.360
You should eat too.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880
Thank you all.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240
It's delicious.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.040
- It's delicious.
- Yum.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.080
Since you're here,

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.200
come in and sit for a bit.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320
That's true.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.000
My mom would just kick you out.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.240
You brat, you have no manners.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.640
You didn't treat me
as a bratty kid...

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.960
when you asked me
to do your dirty work, did you?

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.560
It was my fault.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.280
I didn't expect things
to turn out this way.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.040
But now that you've brought
the police here,

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.159
what will the Old City District
think of you?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160
It won't matter anymore.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600
I'm leaving.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200
What about your mom?

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.880
What about your siblings?

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.680
We're leaving together.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.440
I can't go to jail.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.560
Otherwise, Han Kui Long's men
will definitely kill me.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.480
What did you offer the police?

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.280
Hello.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.240
Wei, what's the situation now?

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720
I don't know.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.480
Bao won't say anything.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120
Dad.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.400
Here's my passport.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.200
Are we really leaving?

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.656
You're always making
all the decisions.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.720
Don't I have a choice?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Not this time.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.000
We're leaving in an hour.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.399
Pack your things.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400
Hurry.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.760
Is it that wretched judge?

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520
Bao.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.719
You know how much the police...

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.440
dislike the people
of the Old City District.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.760
Do you remember...

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.280
how they ruined my career
as a police officer?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.040
Do you really think the police...

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.600
sincerely want you
to turn state's evidence?

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.880
Trust me.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.800
I'll definitely find a way
to help you.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.480
If I get arrested too,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.720
both our families will be doomed.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.960
So only sacrificing me...

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.680
is all worth it?

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.560
I'm so tired.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.520
I couldn't sleep a wink...

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.240
in the detention center.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.800
Did you tell Grandma
that we're going to Canada?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.960
I'll tell her when we get there.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.280
Why are we going so suddenly?

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080
Mr. Qin.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.560
Ma Shan Bao just sent me a message.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.120
He asked me to prepare
all the documents by tomorrow.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520
I think...

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.440
he's ready to tell us
who the real culprit is.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080
That's great.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280
I didn't think...

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.000
we would actually succeed.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.680
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.160
Okay, keep up the good work.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.880
Is this the travel agency?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.040
Let's just say
we're going on a trip.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840
It's so late.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.080
It's obvious we're on the run.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.599
That's right, we are on the run.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.360
It's obvious, okay?

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.400
Then how will I go to school?

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.800
You still have to work.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640
I'll make arrangements.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.680
You always arrange everything
on your own.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.080
You never tell me anything.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.840
You didn't discuss things with Mom
back then either.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880
Yi Wei.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320
For the past six months,

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880
because of your mom,

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.319
I haven't really talked to you...

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.560
or discussed anything with you.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.720
She was the one I loved the most.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.840
I never thought...

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.160
she would choose
to leave me like this.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760
This time,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.720
perhaps it's a test for us.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.880
There are only
the two of us left now.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.720
We must stick together.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.800
Don't question me...

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.240
or interrogate me anymore.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520
Okay?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.480
Are we never coming back?

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.160
Yi Wei.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.280
Stop talking to me about Mom!

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.280
Why did you become like this?

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.559
Because you didn't let me
turn myself in!

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.919
No, you hit someone with your car
and committed a hit and run.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.240
- Now, the police are after you.
- Then let them arrest me!

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280
Yi Wei!

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400
Yi Wei!

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.200
Wei Wei.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.480
What's wrong?

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560
What happened?

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.760
Where's your dad?

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.200
I knew something was up.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.399
You two wouldn't tell me anything.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400
Grandma.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.080
Can you let me rest for a bit?

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.080
Don't ask me anything now.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.279
I won't.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.399
I won't ask you anything.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.480
Come on. Let's go inside.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.679
Don't be afraid. Grandma's here.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.519
You're always welcome here.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520
Come.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.000
Ma Shan Bao is ready to tell us
who the real culprit is.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880
Ma Shan Bao.

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720
I'm sorry.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.840
I don't want to get you killed.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.760
I just want to save my son.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440
We received a tip-off.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760
It's the same person.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.120
He said the person
who hit Han Gang...

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.560
is Ma Shan Bao.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.120
He lives in the Old City District.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840
Right now,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.200
the police are protecting him.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.360
Qin Yu.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.040
What are you doing?

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.359
You didn't answer my calls,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.560
and you're not home.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.320
Is Yi Wei at your place?

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.960
He is with me.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.639
What happened between you two?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.560
You know, I asked him,
but he wouldn't tell me anything.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120
Just remember.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.440
Don't let him leave.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.679
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.440
Can you not be like this?

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.360
You won't tell me anything.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.759
When things get serious,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.640
I won't be able to help you.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.239
Let me tell you.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.039
I won't let what happened
to Lan Lan...

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.120
happen again.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840
Tomorrow.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.120
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.040
Just don't let Yi Wei leave.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.000
He's asleep now.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.640
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800
Uncle.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960
Uncle.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160
Go home.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360
Bao.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.840
I don't blame you for this.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.760
You're innocent anyway.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440
You'll be fine.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.240
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.240
Please take good care
of your aunt...

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.360
- and your cousins for me.
- Uncle.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.840
I won't betray you.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360
What did you say?

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.360
I'll give them a name.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.376
But it'll be the name of a bad guy
in the Old City District.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.400
After that,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.799
my mom, my siblings, and I...

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800
will leave this place.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.896
We won't have to worry
about them seeking revenge.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.200
You're going to lie to them?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440
Will it work?

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.920
Ms. Zhou said
they've made a promise.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.360
As long as I give them
a name before 9am,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.760
they'll activate
the State's Evidence Program.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200
Then,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.840
our family can leave this place.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400
Hello.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.400
Mr. Qin.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.320
Why can't I reach you
on your mobile phone?

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.960
I'm about to leave now.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520
Wish me luck.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.840
Okay.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.600
Be careful.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520
Please leave a message.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240
Judge Qin.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.440
Bao won't say anything.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.280
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320
Come here.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.039
- Mommy, I want to play with this.
- All right.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.639
My shirt is dirty again.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.720
- Hold it for me.
- Wash it for me.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.280
All right.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.359
Sis, let me play with it.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360
Xiao Xue.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.240
We bought breakfast.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.160
- Where's Bao?
- Don't play here.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.480
Come and eat something.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.440
Let's have breakfast.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.120
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.760
- Let's eat. Let's have breakfast.
- Come and eat.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.160
Here, put it here.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.200
Here, eat this.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.360
Didn't the lawyer say she'd be here?

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.799
Last night, she told me
she'd come this morning.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800
She should be here soon.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240
I'll take some to them.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240
I'll do it.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.359
They'll feel more at ease...

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.600
if they see I haven't run away.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960
Here.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.240
Eat up.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400
Have some porridge.

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.840
- Have some.
- Thank you.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960
Here.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240
Be careful!

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.040
Watch them!

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.800
We can't hold them off
much longer! Run!

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.800
Watch them for me.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920
Bao!

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240
Is he okay?

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.640
Bao.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.640
Bao!

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240
Bao!

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.920
Bao!

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720
Bao!

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.200
- Bao!
- Bao!

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.160
Bao, are you all right?

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680
Bao!

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960
Bao!

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.880
Don't scare me, Bao!

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.120
Bao, don't scare me!

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720
Bao!

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.080
Wake up, Bao!

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.760
Don't scare me!

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040
Bao!

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560
Bao!

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.240
Wake up!

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.400
Bao!

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.800
Don't do this, Bao!

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.160
Bao, don't do this!

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.560
Open your eyes and look at me.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.800
Bao!
