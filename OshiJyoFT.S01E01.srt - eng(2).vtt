No matter what fate the future holds.

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:13.828
I will walk towards the light that is you.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.390
Until eternity.

About the meeting with T LAND America mentioned in yesterday's email...

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:27.820
I can't seem to free up any time.

I've already moved the management meeting, so let's schedule it for that time slot.

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:46.207
Kaiseki cuisine, a favorite of the president of UICs.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.511
It's about time I visited the Hong Kong branch for an inspection.

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:51.619
How about we schedule it for the beginning of next month?

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.619
I am currently coordinating with the Hong Kong branch.

00:02:53.727 --> 00:02:56.162
You're starting to read my mind.

00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:57.902
My sincerest apologies.

00:02:57.902 --> 00:02:59.405
That was a compliment.

The perfume endorsement contract has been renewed.

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:12.975
Seriously?

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.485
Hell yeah!

00:03:14.507 --> 00:03:17.055
And it looks like we're going to land that TV series, too.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:17.978

He seems to be really popular right now.

Are you a fan, too?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.770
No, I'm not.

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.650
Mr. President, please excuse my forwardness.

00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:15.508
Sorry to trouble you with these things.

Minami-senpai always goes straight home.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.319
Seems like she has a secret.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.605
You're right. I wonder where she goes.

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:24.107
The public filming for the drama series "Rival" is about to begin.

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.347
The star of my life...

00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:38.095
is shining so brightly today.

00:05:39.993 --> 00:05:42.462
First, let me introduce the cast.

00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:47.195
Playing the role of Ao Kirishima, a secret agent and company president, Mr. Shun Himuro!

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.931
And playing Kirishima's rival,

00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:58.076
Getting ready for the take. Cameras, stand by.

00:05:58.142 --> 00:06:00.851
Scene one, ready...

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.345
Action!

00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.220
It's been five years since Shun and Kazuki co-starred in that 2.5D stage play.

00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:12.836
I can't believe I get to witness their chemistry in person again.

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.915
Oh, God of Lotteries, thank you for choosing me from among so many applicants.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:20.120
I am truly grateful.

00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:24.903
So cute.

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:28.107
If I had a young boyfriend like that...

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.691
Alright, that's not happening in this reality.

00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:47.722
A company president who's also a spy... a James Bond-like character.

00:06:47.722 --> 00:06:50.182
It's like the role was tailor-made for Shun.

00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:52.284
He really is a genius.

00:06:57.031 --> 00:07:00.727
Ao... I wish that we...

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.943
had never met.

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:05.979
This is our destiny.

00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:17.734
Toru...

00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.844
Why...?

00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:26.221
Because...

00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:32.336
I can't bring myself to shoot you.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:35.495
I...

00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:38.515
Calm down. It's okay.

00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.240
Cut! That was great.

00:07:47.057 --> 00:07:48.512
Come on.

00:07:48.592 --> 00:07:50.572
-Thanks. -Nice.

00:07:52.268 --> 00:07:54.531
-That was amazing. -You too.

00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:55.865
So cool...

00:07:55.865 --> 00:08:01.169
I... am chasing this star called "idol" with all my might.

00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:05.659
And I always will be.

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:13.432
Thank you, everyone.

00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:16.986
It's now time for a group photo.

00:08:16.986 --> 00:08:19.306
You're free to upload the photos to social media.

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:21.367
So... so dazzling.

00:08:21.528 --> 00:08:23.996
He's so beautiful, yet it awakens my motherly instincts.

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:24.979
So captivating.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.747
So divine... absolutely divine.

00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:32.972
Is he coming this way?

00:08:32.972 --> 00:08:34.108
Huh? Huh?

00:08:34.108 --> 00:08:36.108
Wait a minute...

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:51.472
There it is! The unexpected wink from tsundere Shun!

00:08:51.472 --> 00:08:53.654
Are you okay? Wake up!

00:08:53.674 --> 00:08:56.674
Snap out of it!

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:01.085
Ai...

00:09:01.388 --> 00:09:02.980
Are you okay?

00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:07.560
Shun was so handsome today.

00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:10.625
-So hot. -Drop-dead gorgeous. So cute.

00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:12.043
He's definitely going to take over the world.

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:14.054
He's totally world-class. World-class.

00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.695
I pre-ordered the "Labyrinth Prince" DVD, too.

00:09:17.736 --> 00:09:21.329
I can't believe they're including behind-the-scenes extras for that masterpiece. Bless the production team.

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:22.754
All hail the production team!

00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:25.524
We have to get tickets for the "Labyrinth Prince" encore performance.

00:09:25.527 --> 00:09:27.467
-Yeah! -We absolutely have to!

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:30.175
Shun is focusing on TV dramas and movies now.

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:32.880
It's been so long since I've seen him in a 2.5D play.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.313
-I feel like I'm going to cry from happiness. -I know, right?

00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:36.718
I'm so happy I'm his fan.

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:39.179
-Yeah. -The absolute happiest.

00:09:39.227 --> 00:09:42.514
Hurry! I heard Shun ate this once in his private time.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:43.497
Let's take a picture first.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:46.819
Ah, I forgot to bring my acrylic standee! Dammit!

00:09:55.247 --> 00:09:57.157
I brought some dishes from home.

00:09:57.194 --> 00:09:59.285
Mom told me to give you some.

00:09:59.504 --> 00:10:03.263
I went to a fan event tonight. We all went wild at karaoke afterwards.

00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:07.389
Sounds like fun. I support you.

00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:16.270
I've found the star of my life.

00:10:19.617 --> 00:10:22.819
Thanks to my idol, every day is a happy one.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:26.073
Not only have I made friends who get me...

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.800
but I'm also more motivated at work.

00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:46.176
Shun, thank you again for today.

00:10:46.176 --> 00:10:48.176
I'll do my best again tomorrow.

00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:04.462
Excuse me.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.400
Mr. President?

00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:10.913
Mr. President... what's wrong?

00:11:10.968 --> 00:11:14.947
Mr. President...!

00:12:16.023 --> 00:12:19.605
(My Fave is My Boss: Full Throttle)

00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:29.921
(Takahiro Nikaido, Senior Managing Director of TAKASHIRO)

00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:33.050
He must have been feeling chest pains for a while.

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:38.210
He's resting now. You should go home.

00:12:39.146 --> 00:12:40.593
Yes, sir.

00:12:41.448 --> 00:12:43.396
The president is getting older. I'm really worried.

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.797
If the worst should happen...

00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:47.443
will Mr. Nikaido be the new president?

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:49.517
No, this company follows hereditary succession.

00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:53.014
But I heard the president's only son started a business abroad and never came back.

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:55.591
What a spendthrift rich kid.

00:12:55.632 --> 00:12:57.950
His grandson, Mr. Hayate, is at the Thailand branch...

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.657
but they say he doesn't get along with the president.

00:12:59.657 --> 00:13:01.214
Actually, I heard he hates him.

00:13:01.229 --> 00:13:03.064
No wonder he was sent off to Thailand.

00:13:03.107 --> 00:13:05.856
He actually has another grandson.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.708
But his name, age, and occupation have never been made public.

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:09.608
What?

00:13:11.627 --> 00:13:15.326
The president is still in critical condition.

00:13:15.326 --> 00:13:17.974
If outsiders were to find out about this...

00:13:18.003 --> 00:13:22.063
it could affect the contract signing with President Asagiri next week.

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:24.553
Everyone must keep this strictly confidential.

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:28.996
And be on the lookout for reporters.

00:13:29.703 --> 00:13:31.572
Lately, it's not just reporters.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.951
There are also those troublemakers who upload photos online.

00:13:37.706 --> 00:13:40.984
In any case, be extremely cautious of suspicious individuals.

00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:43.041
The internet...

00:13:44.152 --> 00:13:47.153
Minami, could you deliver something to the president?

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:48.418
Of course.

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:12.078
I'm so sorry. I didn't notice you weren't feeling well.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.410
It's not your fault.

00:14:15.283 --> 00:14:19.110
I was too anxious about the contract signing...

00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:21.433
and ignored my health.

00:14:21.492 --> 00:14:23.416
I brought this upon myself.

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.118
Mr. President...

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.718
Perhaps it's time for a fresh breeze in the company.

00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:36.046
I'll be counting on you after the new president takes over.

00:14:36.227 --> 00:14:38.718
Please don't say such things.

00:14:38.718 --> 00:14:42.083
You need to get well soon and come back to the company.

00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:48.370
A new president...

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.550
I forgot my phone.

00:15:06.594 --> 00:15:09.064
Be extremely cautious of suspicious individuals.

00:15:11.685 --> 00:15:13.136
Sir.

00:15:14.278 --> 00:15:15.632
Hey.

00:15:16.903 --> 00:15:18.770
Stop!

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.340
Don't run!

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:24.772
Your phone! Let me see your phone!

00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:28.093
You were secretly taking pictures just now, weren't you? I saw you with my own two eyes.

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:31.358
Don't run anymore! Show me your face!

00:15:31.396 --> 00:15:33.814
Someone! There's a suspicious person here!

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.472
Hey...!

00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:47.334
Huh? No way...

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.176
Come here.

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:07.689
An idol... is holding my hand?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.198
I'm not a suspicious person.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.492
Ouch.

00:16:35.492 --> 00:16:39.197
Thank goodness. I slipped out in the middle of a shoot.

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:41.870
It would have been a disaster if fans had surrounded me. That scared me.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.483
I can't believe I hit my beloved idol.

00:16:55.368 --> 00:16:57.951
Why was he even there? Was he really a suspicious person?

00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.105
No... that's impossible. He must have just happened to be at the hospital.

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:05.295
What on earth have I done?

00:17:05.328 --> 00:17:08.062
He definitely remembers my face now. To be remembered for something like this...

00:17:08.085 --> 00:17:10.085
It's the humiliation of a lifetime!

00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:14.944
I can never go to a fan meet again! Dammit!

I'm at a dead end.

Times like this call for a change of scenery.

00:17:38.134 --> 00:17:42.738

Ouch.

00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:13.462
I will never run away.

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:17.839
No matter what fate the future holds.

00:18:18.012 --> 00:18:21.019
I will walk towards the light that is you.

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:24.039
Until eternity.

00:18:29.287 --> 00:18:30.975
He's absolutely sparkling.

00:18:31.322 --> 00:18:35.220
Why do I feel so moved, so thrilled?

00:18:42.111 --> 00:18:45.809
I've found the star of my life.

It's my turn next. What do I do?

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.037
I'll do my best. Thank you.

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:21.687
Do you have a cold?

00:19:22.934 --> 00:19:24.240
No...

00:19:25.384 --> 00:19:26.672
I see.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.322
You don't want to shake my hand?

00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:39.132
I do!

00:19:53.527 --> 00:19:54.787
See you next time.

00:19:54.856 --> 00:19:57.408
See you next time...

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.756
From that day on, he became my star.

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:08.984
My Southern Cross, guiding my way.

00:20:08.984 --> 00:20:10.843
And yet...

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:13.838
my star vanished. And I'm the one who destroyed him.

00:20:13.844 --> 00:20:16.557

My idol... the star of my life...

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.419
The shock of him disappearing, not just from my life,

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:10.147
but from the entire world, was too much.

00:21:10.147 --> 00:21:12.215
Why? How?
