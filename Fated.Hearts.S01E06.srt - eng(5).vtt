[Fated Hearts]

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.009
[Episode 6]

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.509
Xueying.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.400
It's okay.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.840
-You're back.
-You're finally back.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.789
Will you dare to run off like that again?

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.720
So disobedient.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.039
Yixiao.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000
-Master!
-Master!

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.230
Master.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.230
Master.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.800
You're finally back.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.870
Her Ladyship has been worried sick.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.590
How are you?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.110
You're not hurt, are you?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.190
Master.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.200
What are you crying for?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.280
I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.160
It's not like I died or anything.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.890
Stop crying.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.290
Did you practice today?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.450
Yes.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.720
Then let me see

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.350
if you've made any progress.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.590
Since these kids

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.240
arrived,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.910
the mansion has never been this lively.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.840
His Highness's never liked crowds.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.560
I wonder why

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.710
he didn't lose his temper this time.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.800
Indeed.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.400
Alright, that's enough.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.160
You left and never came back.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.630
They've been crying the whole time,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.630
saying they'll never be naughty

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.960
or make you angry again.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.570
Alright, Eleven,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.940
take them back to rest.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.590
Get some water

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.920
and wash their faces and bodies properly.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.500
Go back now.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.120
If you dare run off again,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.250
you'll be punished.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.280
Got it.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.360
Let's go back and wash up, shall we?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.520
Let's go, Shunzi.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.680
Bath time.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.040
Bath time, Nine.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.680
Let's go.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.630
Who exactly kidnapped Fang?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.700
Some people from Jinxiu.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.120
Do you know them?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.630
They claimed to be my comrades.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.630
What kind of person
would treat their own comrades like this?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.650
From what I see,
there aren't many decent ones

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.450
among you Jinxiu people either.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.360
Yixiao,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.970
you must be careful.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.190
I originally thought

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.000
Feng Suige was

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.360
a cold-blooded killer,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.280
but now I see

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.150
that people from Jinxiu

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.550
can't be trusted either.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.560
You're now deep in the heart of danger,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.760
with nowhere to turn.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.290
It's just about
surviving in desperate situations

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.089
and seeking victory in danger.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.520
I'm just worried about the kids.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.230
Don't worry.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.960
There must be a solution.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.760
[Murong Residence] [Tea House] [Market]

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.290
Your Highness.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.480
Your Highness.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.830
Those Jinxiu undercover guards

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.000
who fell into the river have been found.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.890
None of them survived.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.040
But most importantly,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.430
their faces are completely disfigured,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.159
unrecognizable from

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.290
what they once were.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.850
Should I have the coroner's artist

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.920
try to reconstruct them,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.920
see if we can restore their appearance?

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.320
No need to probe further,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.310
nor concern yourself

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.909
with their real identities.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.920
As long as they're from Jinxiu.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.510
Hang their bodies from the city gate.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.240
At dawn, when the gates open,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.940
I'll let everyone know

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.070
that Jinxiu sent assassins against me.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.630
Understood.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.510
But about that shipment of oil...

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.160
Any news?

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.060
No.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.070
The person in charge of oil

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.390
at the Armaments Bureau has gone missing.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.070
Seems they've been silenced.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.030
Indeed.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.330
I've been thinking about that too.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.720
Are you saying

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.630
someone actually coordinated with Jinxiu

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.630
to take your life?

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.830
Even Prime Minister Zhuang

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.240
wouldn't dare

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.190
be so blatant.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.630
This is happening right here
in Yujing City,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.680
under the Emperor's nose.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.120
So...

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.190
Should I continue investigating?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.720
No need.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.870
This lead is already dead.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.630
Your Majesty, Her Highness is here.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.170
I pay my respects to you, Mother.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.730
I heard you couldn't sleep last night,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.800
so I had some calming tea prepared

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.360
and found some century-old ginseng
from Mount Ling,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.890
hoping it will help you
sleep better, Mother.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.460
Among all these children,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.460
you're the sweetest.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.550
All the care I've given you
hasn't been in vain.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.340
Xiyang,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.830
do you know why

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.290
I summoned you here today?

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.870
You all may leave.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.190
Yes.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.870
I'm guessing,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.120
Mother, you summoned me here

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.380
for the matter of the marriage alliance.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
You're always so clever,

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.040
just as I like.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.070
That clever mind of yours

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.730
really seems to take after me.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.830
You're just like my own daughter.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.360
You've always

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.040
treated me as your own.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.630
I remember when we kids were little,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.270
Chengyang would always complain

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.070
that you were biased in my favor.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.430
You've grown up now

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.130
and reached the age for marriage,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.070
yet I'm so reluctant to let you go.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.540
I know you care for me.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.070
About this marriage alliance,

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.530
since you already know,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.560
I'd like to hear

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.940
your thoughts on it.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.770
Don't worry,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.290
if you're unwilling,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.990
no one can force you.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.090
But will Father agree?

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.510
I'll decide for you.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.360
Even if your father gets angry,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.970
he can only

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.440
blame me.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.070
I'd rather face his anger

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.870
than let you suffer.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.120
Mother, you've taught me since childhood

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.650
that as a princess of Susha,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.690
I must contribute to our kingdom,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.170
and I've always remembered that.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.560
Now

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.240
is the time for me

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.420
to serve Susha.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.880
So you mean...

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.510
I'm willing to go through with
the marriage alliance.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.870
You've truly grown up now.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.560
Even when it comes to important matters
like marriage,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.390
you have your own thoughts.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.800
It really puts my mind at ease.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.430
Why did you mysteriously call me out

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.790
so early in the morning?

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.310
What's going on?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.390
I'm not planning to

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.030
stay at Feng Suige's residence any longer.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.760
I can't eat or sleep well there.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.210
I'm planning to purchase

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.210
a house in Yujing.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.500
Didn't we agree

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.510
that you'd take the three kids

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.909
back to Zhengnian Villa?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.789
Those three kids

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.150
have their hearts set on you.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.200
We may have fooled them once,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.840
but can we fool them a second time?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.440
Besides,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.910
leaving Susha might not be safe either.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.960
I've thought it all through.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.270
Once you've finished your business,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.570
we can leave together.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.150
I'll handle my own affairs

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.940
by myself.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.770
Don't worry.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.810
Actually, all these matters

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.790
have nothing to do with you.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.870
You don't have to stay in Yujing.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.740
That won't do.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.120
You're someone I rescued,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.510
which makes you one of our own.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.240
Of course I need to protect you.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.930
Why are you so nice to me?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.160
Because you saved me.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.190
We share a life-and-death bond.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600
I'm an only child,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.390
and I've always envied

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.790
others who have sisters.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.960
Eleven is like a little sister to me.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.070
I've always wished

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.610
I can have an older sister.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.670
Why don't you be my older sister?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.650
How about we become sworn sisters?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
What do you think?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.000
Would you like that?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.750
Would you?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.720
Alright,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.200
I'll do as you say.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.500
Then it's settled.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.960
From now on, we'll share our blessings

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960
and face hardships together.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.490
You're my older sister now.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.630
Sister.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.550
Sister.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.990
Sister.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.410
Call me too. Come on.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.080
Sister.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.080
Sister.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.750
Sister.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.900
From now on, I'll have an older sister!

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.630
[Real Estate Agency]

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.790
Here we are.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.570
I want the best house you have.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.570
-Honored guests, lease come in.
-I'm buying it today.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.000
So you're the young mistress

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.080
of Zhengnian Villa.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.140
The house has been tidied up.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.140
This way, please.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.270
I'll need to sign
and put it on the account.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.530
Is that really doable?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.980
Of course.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.130
You're our most honored guest.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.790
Money is negotiable

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.200
I'm putting it on your emperor,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.450
Feng Pingcheng's account, though.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.780
No problem. No problem.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.030
How do you two feel about

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.610
this house? Are you satisfied?

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.900
I'm quite satisfied.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.000
Thank you for your trouble.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.960
Then I shall take my leave

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.580
and not disturb you further.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.150
Charging it to Feng Pingcheng's account?

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.610
You're really something.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.910
That's actually doing Feng Pingcheng
a favor, alright?

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.020
Whether it's Emperor of Jinxiu

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.080
or Feng Pingcheng,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.150
they both want to earn favors

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.030
with my Zhengnian Villa.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.000
Now that I've brought it to him myself,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.200
Feng Pingcheng will certainly accept.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.200
By the way,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:11.970
Sister,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.240
once I bring Fang here,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.120
this place will be

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.390
our home in Yujing City.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.510
We have a home now!

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.580
Come take a look.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.000
This will serve as a clinic,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.130
specifically for treating patients.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.080
And this area will be the pharmacy.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.510
Sister, there's also a garden in the back.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.570
I'll go take a look.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.790
We have a home now,

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.150
a place to call our own here.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.240
Now, I can leave

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.500
Feng Suige's residence whenever I want.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.270
But

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.000
why don't I feel happy about it?

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.470
Grandfather.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.090
I've been

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.610
diligently practicing
my calligraphy lately.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.120
Please take a look.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.500
[A good man has built a hut in the valley
by the stream, so much at his ease.]

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:55.670
[Alone he sleeps and speaks when awake,
and will surely not forget.]

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.790
Have I made progress?

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.000
[A good man has built a hut at the bend
of the mound, an air of indifference.]

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.390
[Alone he sleeps and sings when awake,
and will never pass from the spot.]

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.000
[A good man has built a hut
on the level height, so self-collected.]

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.150
[Alone he sleeps, wakes and sleeps again,
and swears he will never tell.]

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.670
Have you shown it to your father?

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.080
Not yet.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.790
I was thinking

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.240
of getting your guidance first,
Grandfather.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440
After I make improvements,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.840
I'll show it to my father.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.210
Have you forgotten what I taught you?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.360
You said before

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.870
that all of my writings

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.270
must be reviewed by my father first.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.720
You must always keep in mind the proper
principles between ruler and subject.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.120
You are a prince of Susha.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.180
Apart from your tutors,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.250
only your father

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.360
has the right to evaluate your work.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.870
Yes.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.710
Grandfather,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.550
I'm going to study now.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.860
I take my leave.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.720
Your handwriting is gentle and dignified,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.920
but lacks decisiveness and sharpness.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.670
Your father

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.240
won't like it.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.240
Thank you, Grandfather,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.280
I shall take my leave.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.630
Father.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:08.360
Empress.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.630
You must be feeling more at ease
now that you've talked to Xiyang, right?

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.320
Indeed.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.270
You're truly prescient, Father.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.600
But how did you know

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.630
that Xiyang would certainly agree?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.960
Compared to Feng Suige,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.750
Chengyang's character

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.880
is truly too gentle.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.390
He's not suited to be a ruler.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.200
But whether he is or isn't
doesn't really matter.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.130
The one who will inherit the throne

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.670
can only be Chengyang.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.280
Chengyang's future

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.580
depends entirely on you, Father.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.280
It's the future of the entire Zhuang clan.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.420
By the way,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.600
I heard that early this morning,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.670
Feng Suige hung the bodies of

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.870
a few undercover guards from Jinxiu

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.800
at the city gate,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.850
claiming he was assassinated.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.870
Do you think he'll

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.010
ruin our plans?

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.170
Since you already know

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.080
the princess's thoughts,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.360
why should you worry?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.950
Father, you mean that

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.410
no matter how Feng Suige

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.640
interferes,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.720
His Majesty's final decision

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.790
will depend on

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.360
whether she's willing to go through with
the marriage alliance or not?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.190
If she's not willing,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.360
once she marries into Jinxiu,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.080
she will

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.000
become a hidden threat.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.640
His Majesty surely understands this.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:32.740
[I, Fang Chengyu, Governor of Yuzhou,
kneel to submit this memorial]

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.050
[Memorial]

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.450
What did you just say

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.650
you came here for today?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.080
I ask you to uphold justice
for me, Father.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.210
You've never

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.630
asked me to intervene

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.290
in anything since childhood.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.120
Today's matter is different.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.600
I encountered

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.510
an assassination attempt
by Jinxiu's undercover guards

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.840
and nearly lost my life.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.720
However, as it concerns Jinxiu

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.750
and political affairs
between the two kingdoms,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.680
I dare not make decisions on my own.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.790
You hung those bodies at the city gate.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.450
You seem quite decisive to me.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.750
It doesn't seem that
you dare not make decisions on your own.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.320
Please understand, Father.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.930
It's only because the assassins' bodies

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.160
were disfigured

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.440
that I ordered them hung at the gate,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.150
only to

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.870
help Jinxiu identify them

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.600
and retrieve them promptly.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.710
How thoughtful of you.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.020
This is what I should do.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.290
Since it was Jinxiu

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.200
who proposed the marriage alliance,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200
though they speak sweetly but harbor evil,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.800
seeking peace on the surface

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.780
while attacking in secret,

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.440
I must still consider the dignity
of our kingdom

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.040
and everyone's reputation,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.550
and cannot openly
tear our relations apart.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.270
Fortunately, I was lucky

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.120
to survive this time.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:58.960
Even if Jinxiu

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.600
continues to

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.000
send assassins after me,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.390
as the First Prince of Susha,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.960
I must prioritize the bigger picture

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.320
and practice restraint.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.320
All decisions

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.350
are yours to make, Father.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:14.000
If the assassins' faces
are unrecognizable,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.200
how can you be certain

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.960
that they were from Jinxiu?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.980
I have a witness.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.200
You haven't told me

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.860
how I should repay this favor.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.900
It's simple.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.930
You just need to tell the truth.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.310
I need you to testify

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.390
that those people

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.280
are Jinxiu's undercover guards.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.620
That's it?

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.360
Is it really that simple?

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.160
Actually, it's not that simple.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.080
You need to consider that
agreeing to help me

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.880
is equivalent to
betraying your former comrades.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.440
Otherwise, I'll kill him!

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.960
They wanted to kill Fang.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.720
What kind of comrades are they?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.560
I'll help you.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.000
This is my witness's testimony,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.000
sufficient to prove

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.860
the identity of those assassins.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840
Your witness

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.440
is that woman named Fu Yixiao,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.500
a female general from Jinxiu, right?

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.829
She has lost her memory
and her background is unknown.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.369
Using her as a witness

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.880
won't convince anyone.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.119
Then I request Your Majesty

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.880
to reject Jinxiu's
marriage alliance proposal.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.640
This way, I can openly

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200
investigate the assassins' identities

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.000
and offer you evidence

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.130
that will convince everyone, Father.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:20.960
It's too late.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.960
Xia Jingshi

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.430
will soon arrive in Yujing.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.720
I've already sent a reply to Jinxiu.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.440
The marriage alliance
between the two kingdoms

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.920
has been decided.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.100
Please, Father,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.070
revoke that order.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.400
A ruler's word cannot be taken back.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.720
How can I revoke it?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.680
Whether to marry or not

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.240
is just a matter of your word, Father.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.570
This matter is settled.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.890
There's nothing more to discuss.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.170
If that's the case,

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.920
then I

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.880
have one more unreasonable request!

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.620
Since Jinxiu wants me dead,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.720
and since you, Father,

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.110
don't care whether I live or die,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.840
then I beg you to issue the order

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.240
that on the day Xia Jingshi

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.060
marries Xiyang,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.920
grant me death.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.400
Consider it as adding some excitement

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.930
to this marriage alliance!

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.190
You think

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.110
I don't have the heart to kill you?

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.490
Of course you do!

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:23.720
For the sake of
peace and self-preservation,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.350
you even have the heart

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.530
to send your only daughter

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.530
into hell!

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.030
Of course you have no remorse

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.240
about losing another son!

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.470
If this marriage alliance
is to go through,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.850
it'll only be over my dead body.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.000
Please forgive me, Father.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.610
I heard everything from outside

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.730
and didn't have the time
to request an audience properly.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.590
Xiyang?

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.410
Xiyang.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.440
Now that you're here,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.870
tell him yourself.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.090
Brother.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.170
I'm willing to accept
the marriage alliance.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.530
Have you lost your mind?

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.070
Brother.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.680
-Xiyang.
-I've always wanted to tell you that...

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.920
You don't have to compromise

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.270
and agree to this marriage alliance.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.750
I was about to win just now.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.590
I've been deliberately

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.400
pressing the issue of the Jinxiu assassin,

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.450
making sure all of

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.740
Yujing knows about it,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.720
just to force Father

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.050
to turn against Jinxiu.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.960
I provoked Father to sentence me to death

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.350
to make him understand that

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.200
If he insists on this marriage alliance,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.660
I, Feng Suige, will fight

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.880
to the death to prevent it.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.680
I know you can't

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.880
see the situation clearly now,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.350
but you only need to know that

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.510
no one can force you

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.710
to marry Xia Jingshi.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.380
Not even Father.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.110
Father has now

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.310
painted himself into a corner.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.710
Be a little more patient,

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.680
I will continue to find ways

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.810
to pressure Father.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.000
Today, I'll definitely

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.660
force him to revoke his order.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.160
Brother.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.270
Why have you never asked me

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.490
whether I'm willing to marry Xia Jingshi?

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.400
What did you say?

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.840
Father sent someone
to ask about my wishes,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.440
and so did Mother.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.640
I've been waiting

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.640
for you to ask me.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.830
What do you want me to ask you?

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.110
Ask me

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.440
if I'm willing

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.640
to marry Xia Jingshi.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.110
Fine.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.500
I'm asking you.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.030
What is your wish?

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.920
Actually, I...

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.720
Feng Xiyang!

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.690
You'd better think carefully
before you answer me.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.070
I'm willing to marry Xia Jingshi.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.500
Why?

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.680
I like him.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.100
You've met him?

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.850
A chance encounter,

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.660
just once.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.330
He probably doesn't even remember me.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.980
You've only met him once,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.770
and you dare say you like him?

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.270
Brother,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.590
when you meet the right person,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.800
once is enough.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.160
You're aware that he is my enemy.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.530
You've only met him once,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.110
but I'm your brother,

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.920
Feng Xiyang!

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.590
We are flesh and blood.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:03.970
Brother!

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.800
Please grant my wish.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.740
I will not grant it.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.840
Brother.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.430
What have I done wrong?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.640
I just want to marry the man I admire,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.440
and this marriage alliance

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.690
will bring peace.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.280
What wrong have I done?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.000
Because Xia Jingshi

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.750
will always be Susha's enemy!

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.350
No one knows him better than I do.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.960
I know his hypocrisy,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.350
his pretense,

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.880
and his forbearance.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.030
Xia Jingshi's hands

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.070
are stained with the blood of
our Susha warriors,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.590
and my sword is also soaked with

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.240
the blood of his Jinxiu soldiers!

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.720
Between me and Xia Jingshi,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.030
there can never be peace!

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.890
Do you understand?

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.830
That's because

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.350
he hasn't met me before.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960
Brother.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.380
Trust me,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.400
I will change Xia Jingshi.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.790
Why are you so naive?

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.160
Would you dare say

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.680
that you would never fall in love with

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.070
a woman from an enemy kingdom?

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.140
Never.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400
I, Feng Suige, absolutely would not.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.310
Do you dare to swear

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.670
that if you fall in love
with a woman from an enemy kingdom,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.880
you'll be struck by lightning?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.800
I, Feng Suige, swear to heaven,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.480
if I fall in love with a female general
from an enemy kingdom, I...

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.160
Brother!

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.510
Brother, I was wrong.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.590
I'm sorry.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.570
I shouldn't have forced you to swear.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.910
If someone must be struck by lightning,

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.340
it should be me who bears it.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.030
I was wrong.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.460
It was my fault.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.650
Since you truly wish to marry him,

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.690
I shouldn't stand in your way.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.040
I'll support your decision.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.400
[Wutong Mansion]

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.240
Stop them!

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.510
My Lady.

was I famous

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.370
in Susha in the past as well?

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.090
You Three Heroes of Jinxiu

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:22.800
are all Xia Jingshi's

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.330
most prized subordinates.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.730
Ning Fei the fierce general,

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.070
Xiao Weiran the strategist,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.290
and you, Fu Yixiao,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.489
Jinxiu's number one archer.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.580
In our Susha army,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.030
killing Ning Fei and Xiao Weiran

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.280
earns the rank of battalion commander,

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.380
and killing you, Fu Yixiao,

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.840
earns company commander.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.340
So every soldier in Susha

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.360
wants to claim your heads.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.520
That's outrageous!

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.920
It's normal for soldiers
to seek military merit.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.580
No need to take it personally.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.590
Why does killing them
earn battalion commander,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.760
while killing me only earns
company commander?

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.710
Which bastard

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:55.580
set this rule?

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.510
I did.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.580

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.400
Alright, when I get back to camp,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.330
I'll change the rule immediately.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.510
Killing you

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.760
will also earn battalion commander.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.420
How's that?

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.880
That's more like it.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.150
Do you

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.690
look down on women a lot?

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.320
Do you not believe women

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.190
can also fight on the battlefield?

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.320
Then let me ask you,

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:23.960
when you were shot by

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.710
the woman you despised the most

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.190
with a single arrow,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.760
failing when victory was within reach

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.430

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.120
how did it feel?

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.000
How could you bring up one's painful past
to their face?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.930
Don't you get it?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.030
Tearing open wounds
right to someone's face

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.360
is the most satisfying.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.000
I've helped you

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.060

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.810

How did it feel...

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.630
Nothing special.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.250
Victory and defeat are common in war.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.380
Didn't you

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.570
want to cut me down with one stroke?

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.780
Not only that.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.110
I wish I could

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.970
cut you into pieces,
tear you limb from limb,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.450
have you drawn and quartered,
and grind your bones to dust.
