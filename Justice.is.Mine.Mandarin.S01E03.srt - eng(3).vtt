WEBVTT

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
We found something here.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.720
Photograph this.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720
Okay.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.800
Bag it.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Got it.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800
Are you done over there?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.120
We found something.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Madam.

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:21.200
We found it in the passenger seat.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.240
Mr. Qin.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
It's my first time here.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Is it this way?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.600
I didn't expect you to come now.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840
I hope I'm not disturbing.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840
Not at all.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
Have a seat.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.600
It's quite spacious here.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.719
I asked for your opinion when I moved.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.960
You said this is a nice area.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560
I guess you forgot.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.159
I was just passing by,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
so I came up to see you.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
I promised to help you.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560
How is...

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
the car theft case going?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.200
You mean Ma Shan Bao's case?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.080
My client's name is Ma Shan Bao.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
By the way,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
who exactly...

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:52.800
is Cao Wei Er?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.720
What's your relationship with him?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.360
He used to be a cop, too.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.080
We've worked together.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.079
I don't know if it's because of him,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.159
but I feel like...

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.640
Ma Shan Bao isn't very cooperative.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.800
He's the one who wanted a lawyer.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.200
Why wouldn't he cooperate?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.600
I must be too sensitive.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.600
Did Ma Shan Bao...

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.640
tell you anything?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.239
I told him I'm his lawyer,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.320
and that I'm here to help him.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.800
But he wouldn't say anything.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.040
Did he say anything...

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.360
to the police?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.800
It's the same with the police.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.120
He wouldn't say anything.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.039
Maybe it's because he's...

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.400
from Old City District.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.679
People there...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.160
don't really like the police.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.720
It happens all the time.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.920
Who is his presiding judge?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.880
The one you're competing with,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Lu Wei De.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480
Luo Wen.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
Actually, there's something...

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680
I haven't told you.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.960
The police have officially informed me.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.480
The car that was stolen from me...

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.120
was the one Ma Shan Bao stole.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
It's yours?

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.039
You got a lawyer for the suspect who stole your car?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.240
Why did you do that?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.159
I'm sorry.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
That's all I can say.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.760
You have to explain it to me later.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.920
I only found out later...

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200
that the suspect...

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.720
was his nephew.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.000
But I had already called the police.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.080
And I wanted to help that young man.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.080
That's why I came to you.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280
Luo Wen.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.320
Don't we have the same goal...

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.200
to help that young man?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.880
Ma Shan Bao...

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
is indeed pitiful.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.560
I won't give up.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840
Okay.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.480
You're here.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.640
Why don't you go in?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.480
Yi Wei didn't go to school today.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840
Do you know that?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.240
He has grown up.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440
Let him...

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.040
make his own schedule.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.920
I feel like he has issues with his emotions.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.320
I want to take him for counseling.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.519
He only skipped school for one day.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.600
It's not that serious.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.240
You don't care about him.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.080
You don't know what he needs.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.400
I come home every night.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.080
I communicate with him just fine.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280
If he needs anything,

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.560
he can tell me anytime.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.480
Look at how you act.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.159
Just because they don't tell you,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.320
you think everything's fine.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.639
It was like that with Lan Lan.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.640
It's like that with Wei Wei, too.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.519
Should we wait until something happens,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.919
and things get out of hand...

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.000
for you to think it's serious?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
Don't forget,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.600
you haven't given me an explanation...

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.360
for Lan Lan's death.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.640
What explanation should I give you?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.040
What explanation do you want?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.600
She was your daughter.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.160
She was also my wife.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.479
I want to know even more than you...

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.640
what exactly happened.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It's been nine months.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.480
I'm slowly accepting it.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.680
Not everything has an answer...

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360
no matter if you accept it...

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.680
or not.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
Brat.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.160
That's fine.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
That's good enough.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.039
Three rifles...

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040
and 300 rounds of ammunition.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.280
These were found by the police...

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:12.680
during a search of the defendant's home.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.760
The police report states that...

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.280
the weapons...

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.800
were found in the utility room...

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.480
next to the defendant's home,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.480
not inside the house.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.760
Because that utility room...

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960
was not locked,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.040
the prosecution must prove that...

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.359
the weapons were placed there...

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.160
by the defendant and not by others.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.880
And it's obvious...

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280
that the prosecution...

00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:36.760
didn't consider the other possibilities...

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.160
as reasonable doubt.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560
Furthermore,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.240
he tried to mislead the court.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.640
Now, this court requests...

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.839
the prosecution to re-examine...

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.960
all the evidence.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
The indictment...

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.000
must adhere to the two principles...

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200
of truth...

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680
and justice.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
Judge Qin.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960
We may be close,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.239
but there's reasonable doubt.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240
I need to ask you something.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360
Can you explain...

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.560
why this was found in your car?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.640
Is it police property?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
That's right.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's government property.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.520
Our colleagues in Forensics...

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.360
found it under the seat in your car.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.919
You should...

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.320
ask your colleagues first...

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.480
if they...

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480
accidentally dropped it.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
This piece of paper...

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.640
doesn't belong to the Forensic Division.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.920
It should be from a notebook...

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.800
of an officer on duty.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.520
But on the day the evidence was collected,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.080
there was no officer on duty.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.600
My car was missing for 24 hours.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.960
During that time,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
who could have...

00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.280
had access to my car?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.320
I think you should...

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.760
check your men first.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.760
What do you mean by that?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.559
Six months ago,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.040
there was a sergeant who colluded with gangsters.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.400
I sentenced him to three years.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
He...

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
wasn't the only cop...

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.240
I convicted.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.360
What are you implying?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040
Do you still remember...

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
the explosion?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.720
How did someone walk around...

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.759
with a suspected bomb...

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760
and place it in my office?

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640
This proves that,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.919
between you and me,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.360
we have people we can't trust.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960
Do you agree?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.200
Doesn't this look familiar?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.040
Isn't this my handwriting?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.480
It's from my duty log.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.040
It took me two whole days...

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.839
comparing the handwriting of all the officers on duty.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.879
That's how I found you.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.400
Can you give me a reasonable explanation?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.039
I lost it...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.479
at the police station that day.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
I don't know where I put it.

00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:13.079
Don't you know that any missing government property...

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080
has to be reported?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.560
Madam, where did you find it?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
In a stolen car.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.279
It's a stolen car that was allegedly involved...

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.560
in a hit-and-run.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.519
I need an explanation.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.520
How did this piece of paper...

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.920
end up in that car?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200
Why are you asking me?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.600
Are you interrogating me?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.520
Is it because I'm from Old City District?

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.560
Do you know Qi Chang Rong?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.680
Do you think everyone from Old City District...

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.480
has something to do with Qi Chang Rong?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.440
Then do you know Ma Shan Bao?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.040
He is a car theft suspect.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.320
He's from Old City District, too.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.680
So, to you,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.160
everyone from Old City District is a thief.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.599
You haven't answered my question.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600
I don't know him.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.320
I'll ask you again.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520
Madam.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.760
I'm a police officer.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.200
I'm not a thief.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.640
How would a car thief...

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.160
be involved with Qi Chang Rong?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.560
Because the person who got hit...

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.720
is Han Kui Long's son, Han Gang.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400
You...

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600
are suspended.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.760
We will launch an internal probe on you anytime.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160
Please sign here.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.720
- Thank you, Mr. Qin. - Thank you.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.760
Yi Wei.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.320
We're not driving the old one.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800
Come here.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.600
Come on.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600
Let's go for a ride.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.080
Come on.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360
The date written on it...

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.880
was the day Zhuang Sen...

00:12:11.881 --> 00:12:13.320
claimed his duty log went missing.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.080
Then, Judge Qin...

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.520
reported the car missing.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720
After that,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.480
Han Gang was hit by a car.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.160
It all happened on the same day.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960
Don't forget that...

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.440
we arrested many of Han Kui Long's...

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.280
and Qi Chang Rong's men that day.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.640
And Ma Shan Bao, too.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.600
The strangest thing to me is that...

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.640
A duty log isn't valuable.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080
Who would steal it?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.960
There's one last possibility.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.840
Although I still have reservations,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.720
we can't completely rule it out.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.760
One of our own...

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.160
framed Judge Qin...

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.200
to get revenge.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.600
That seems too roundabout.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.680
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with Judge Qin.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.360
Also, there's no evidence.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960
That's right.

00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:06.079
If the culprit's one of us,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080
he wouldn't be so stupid.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680
Are you calling Madam stupid?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160
Get to work,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.160
and stop talking.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.840
You want to quit driving?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The police said...

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.640
I need a learner driver sign because I just got my license.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.680
Let's go buy one now.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.680
It will all be over.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
You're all grown up now.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920
You have to be strong.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840
I want to.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080
Actually,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.160
it's not as bad as you think.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.520
We'll go on with our normal lives.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.400
I'll go back to work,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680
and you'll go to school.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760
Madam.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.120
My lawyer is not here.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120
You can't interrogate me.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080
We'll just chat.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.680
Don't be nervous.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.200
You're not going to plead guilty, are you?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600
Really?

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.200
You have the right to plead not guilty.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.199
But the right to judge...

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.240
is in the judge's hands.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960
What do you think will be his decision?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280
On one hand,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.880
we have a car thief with a record...

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.640
who says he didn't steal the car.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
On the other hand,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.199
we have a respected judge...

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.519
who says he saw the thief...

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.520
at the scene of the stolen car.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.080
Whose testimony do you think...

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400
is more credible?

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.840
How hard is it to tell us how you stole the car?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800
Don't play games.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
Guo Hua.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
Calm down.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Sorry, Madam.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.120
If you really didn't steal the car,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.520
why were you driving it?

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960
Continue questioning him.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
Yes, Madam.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.680
I've completed the application procedures.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.959
Give me a reason...

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.960
why I still can't...

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960
see my client.

00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:41.679
It's my client's right to see a lawyer.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680
If I don't see him today,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.680
I'm not leaving.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720
Please keep it down.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
This is a police station.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720
What's your badge number?

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720
I'm going to file a complaint.

00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:49.040
2795. Tang Xuan's the name.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.840
Use my badge number.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400
Madam.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.800
Did you not tell her...

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.840
our security system is under maintenance,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.920
and we have to reschedule all meetings?

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.560
I told her.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.000
She insisted on making a scene here.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
You can't...

00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:15.880
interrogate my client...

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.360
without a lawyer present.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.080
What proof do you have that...

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.440
I'm interrogating him now?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.320
I...

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.880
am not as patient as Madam.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960
I'll ask you again.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.120
How did the dent get on the car?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.320
How did the car get a dent?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.880
Tell me!

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.280
You're bold.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.960
You're from the Old City District, aren't you?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.680
You hit Han Gang.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.800
He's Han Kui Long's son.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240
Are you not scared?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.039
If we let you go now.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.040
you're dead meat.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160
Are you going to talk or not?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.199
I'm in charge of recording everything...

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.400
that happens here.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.960
Now, I'll write that...

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.480
"Ma Shan Bao broke a glass...

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.200
in the middle of resisting.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Then, by accident,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.560
he was stabbed in the eye with a piece of glass."

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.320
You're doomed then.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.440
Are you going to spill?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.200
I don't have time today.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.600
It won't be like this next time.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160
Do you hear me?

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800
If you have something to say, say it here.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.440
They won't let me see Ma Shan Bao.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440
You're a lawyer.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.520
Shouldn't you take care of it?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.280
I came to tell you that...

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.519
Ma Shan Bao was beaten up in the detention center.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.920
It's not the first time this has happened.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.560
During the last trial,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.800
you saw the wounds on his face.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.640
Try to bail him out.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.040
He wouldn't be beaten up then.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.760
You're his uncle.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.040
If you really care about him,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.360
you should tell his mother...

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.880
to step forward as his guardian.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.400
She can make an official complaint to the court...

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.280
and accuse the police of excessive violence.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.440
Who's the lawyer now?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.560
If I have to do everything myself,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.160
why did I hire you?

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.040
I've done my part.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.760
But Ma Shan Bao refused to cooperate.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960
I want to know...

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.240
who told him not to say anything.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
If you know anything else,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
you must tell me.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.680
Ma Shan Bao is only 18 years old. He's still young.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.360
He's in such a miserable state.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.240
As his family, don't you feel sorry for him?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.400
Please try your best to help him.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680
Wei.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
Do you know that Ma Shan Bao...

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240
was beaten up in the detention center?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.279
You used to be a cop. You should know...

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.040
these things happen all the time.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680
Maybe Bao...

00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:42.880
got into trouble in there.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.999
You know how sensitive the police are...

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.680
when it comes to the people from the Old City District.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.920
The police don't like the Old City District.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.280
Do you think the Old City District likes the police?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280
Wei.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.000
We have to remind Bao...

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.479
not to say anything.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.919
Let the lawyer handle everything.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.400
Bao won't say anything.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.240
Should he betray us in front of the police,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.480
he’ll never be able to show his face again.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.160
Why did you dismantle the car?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.399
Can you stop asking me that?

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400
Why can't I ask?

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.400
I may have been fired,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.440
but I haven’t lost my principles.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.280
Are you hiding something from me?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.920
Either you explain this to me,

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.280
or you explain it to the police.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560
Yes.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.080
I did something wrong this time.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.320
I was wrong.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520
Don't hide it anymore.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:49.720
Yes.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.720
You know that...

00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:52.080
the Xi Wan Road just opened.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.520
I was speeding...

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.800
without realizing it.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I got caught on camera for a violation.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.920
You'll only get a penalty for speeding.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080
That's right.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.519
But the speed limit is 80.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.720
I was going 130.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320
The worst part is,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560
I was really busy at that time.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.160
I forgot my car inspection was overdue.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.479
You know I'm running for...

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.640
Chief Justice.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.679
If the media...

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.800
finds out about this,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.800
not only will I not be able to run for office,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.520
but my professional integrity...

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.640
will also be questioned.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080
That's why...

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.600
I told you to dismantle the car.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.959
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want things...

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960
to get complicated.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560
But now,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.160
I've gotten Bao in trouble.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.400
I feel guilty too.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.800
What do you think...

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.560
we should do now?

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.519
The most troublesome thing now...

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.640
is your apprentice, Luo Wen.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120
What about her?

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120
She's smart.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.319
She guessed someone told Bao not to speak.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.840
She's starting to suspect me.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.960
I don't know how long Bao can hold out.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200
I'm worried that if he's in there,

00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:06.680
someone will kill him eventually.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080
Then,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.440
should I give his family some money?

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.600
How much do they need?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600
Tell me.

00:23:17.601 --> 00:23:19.440
What's the point of having money if he's dead?

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.600
That lawyer apprentice of yours...

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.240
wants to get to the bottom of things.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.520
She doesn't know how to save people.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.120
She's making things...

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.440
even more complicated.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960
How is it?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960
What do you want for takeout today?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.000
You're home, but you're ordering takeout?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.560
Didn't you see Grandma's car outside?

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.999
At home, you should eat...

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.680
fresh and nutritious food.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.200
Wei Wei.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200
Go upstairs and do your homework.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.000
The brisket needs to be braised for a while.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.840
Wei Wei...

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960
is fine. He's doing well.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.960
It's you I'm worried about.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840
Look.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760
First,

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.000
you said your car was stolen.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.560
Then, you said you found it.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.960
Now, it's being seized by the police for evidence.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.640
You won't tell me anything.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.920
Wei Wei said you got a new car, right?

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.479
It's only because that old car...

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
needs to be inspected.

00:24:30.481 --> 00:24:32.280
It'll cost a lot of money to repair it after inspection.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.560
So I bought a new car.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.880
It's nothing.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520
This photo...

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.960
was anonymously sent to a magazine company.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.799
My friend at the magazine company...

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.120
knew that it's my car.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.680
That's why he didn't publish it.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360
After I became a judge,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.560
I've been mentally prepared...

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.280
for these malicious attacks.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880
You may be prepared,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.360
but Wei Wei isn't.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.120
Apart from being a judge,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.640
you're also Wei Wei's father.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.480
It's enough that you know I'm his father.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.879
This is between father and son.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.960
Can you stay out of it?

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.600
He's my grandson!

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.400
If you'd been a good father,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.359
if you'd cared about him, took care of him,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360
and spent more time with him,

00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:14.679
I wouldn't be so worried.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.159
When did I not take care of him?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
I don't have to report to you...

00:25:17.161 --> 00:25:18.560
when I take care of him, do I?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.760
You don't care...

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800
about what he eats every day.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.039
You didn't even know that...

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.040
he skipped school.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.919
After his mom passed away,

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920
he lost so much weight.

00:25:26.921 --> 00:25:28.239
And yet, you didn't notice.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.080
Is that how you care for your son?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.479
He's 19 years old.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.480
He's a college student.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.240
Do you still treat him like a child?

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.439
He goes to school,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440
and I go to work.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520
That's normal.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.679
You are indeed...

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.000
a talented judge.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.280
That's why I let my daughter marry you.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.799
But that doesn't mean...

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.480
all your decisions are right.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.200
For example, your run for Chief Justice.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640
Do you know...

00:25:53.641 --> 00:25:54.919
that once you're elected,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.599
you won't have any personal time?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600
You'll be in court every day.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040
When you get home,

00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:01.360
you'll have to read files and write rulings.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.959
You won't even have time to have takeout...

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960
with your son.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.160
I've been there.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.200
No one understands better than I do.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.960
It's not easy to be a good judge...

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.880
and a good father.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.919
You're not a judge anymore.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.079
This isn't a courtroom.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080
Just because you can't do it...

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080
doesn't mean I can't.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120
I'm sorry.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.800
The braised beef brisket is ready. Call Wei Wei for dinner.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.320
I shouldn't have argued with your grandma.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.640
I know she's looking out for us.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.720
Your mom is gone.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.960
She could solve everything.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.640
Even if I want to throw a tantrum,

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840
I can't.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.400
Are you mad at your mom?

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720
I'm a little mad.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.520
I really don't understand...

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.440
why she left us like that.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880
This family...

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.399
fell apart just like that.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.400
Mom...

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400
Let's go...

00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:42.440
see a movie later.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920
Let's get new sneakers.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920
Maybe next time.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240
I'm going to school.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520
Judge Qin.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520
What brings you here?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
We didn't release...

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
any related photos.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.279
I've cooperated...

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.360
with the police.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120
Like I said,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.160
we didn't do it.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720
Besides,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.720
why would I do that?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.360
Why would I offend a judge...

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.000
I've worked with for years?

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.880
Who do you think is the suspect?

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600
What's with this car?

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440
I'm sorry, Judge Lu.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
No comment.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560
That car,

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.640
it's Judge Qin's, right?

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.360
Please cooperate with us.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760
Judge Lu Wei De,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.800
the one competing with you for Chief Justice.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.600
What's the reason for that?

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.040
On the day of the search,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.480
he passed by the scene.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120
He recognized your car.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640
He and his assistant...

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200
loitered in the parking lot for a while.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.160
That's exactly the kind of thing he'd pull.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.800
He was at the scene.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.520
On top of that, he has a motive.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840
I'm sorry.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.360
It's normal to look for the truth...

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.680
when you have doubts.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160
However,

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.760
I'm just telling you what I saw.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.519
But if you tell anyone...

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.960
that I was the one who told you...

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.200
I'm sorry,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.200
but I'll deny it.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400
Okay.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.440
I can catch the mole at the police station.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.960
But the rat at the courthouse...

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.200
has nothing to do with me.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.520
Okay.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080
Qin Yi Wei.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.320
Are you coming to the game after school today?

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.120
It's a deal. I'll wait for you.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.760
Did you know Cao Wei Er fired me?

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.520
Really?

00:31:09.521 --> 00:31:10.960
I think he fired me because he's guilty.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760
I see.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
Let's talk inside.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.120
You don't have to take it to heart.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760
Because in the future,

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760
you'll meet a lot of...

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760
weird clients.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.960
Cao Wei Er is not just any client.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.920
He's your friend.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.720
Ma Shan Bao and your son are about the same age.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840
Think about it.

00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:13.399
If it was your son who got beaten up today,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400
what would you do?

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.760
The first rule of being a lawyer...

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.359
is not to get emotional...

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360
with your client.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.920
I'm not your student anymore.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.160
You don't have to lecture me like this.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320
Okay.

00:32:27.321 --> 00:32:28.640
I'm just speaking the truth.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.200
Right now, your sympathy...

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.120
is clouding your judgment.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360
Remember this.

00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:36.240
You're a lawyer, not a social worker.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.199
You can't take your client to court...

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.520
just because he replaced you.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.319
You don't need to doubt whether...

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.880
Cao Wei Er wants to save Ma ShanBao.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.640
It's whether you want to save Ma Shanbao or not,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.199
or if you can still...

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.320
save Ma Shan Bao...

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.640
as a lawyer.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.800
As for everything else,

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
I can't answer you.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.360
What else can I do for you?

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320
Bye, Coach.

00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:28.520
Goodbye! I'll see you tomorrow.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600
Bye-bye.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040
What are you looking at?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.599
Nothing. You guys go ahead.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600
Bye, Coach.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600
Bye.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600
See you tomorrow. Bye.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600
Bye, Coach.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.160
Qin Yi Wei.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.600
Are you drinking on school grounds?

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800
Give that to me.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800
Leave me alone.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.879
If the school finds out, you'll get a demerit.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.880
You'll be expelled.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240
Give me that.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240
Leave me alone.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.240
My mom is dead.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.480
I know why she left us.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.280
Don't pity me.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.440
Stop drinking. Give it to me.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.480
Don't do anything stupid.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.800
Did something happen at home?

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120
Hey.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.960
No matter what happens,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.120
drinking is not the way to solve problems.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.920
I know.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.440
I know this can't be solved.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.760
Relax. Calm down.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560
Breathe with me.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920
I'm home.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.920
Hey.

00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:07.120
You're home just in time.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.080
Supper just so happens to be ready as well.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.839
I seriously suspect...

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.480
you planted a tracker in my phone.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.520
Why are you here at this hour?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920
Excuse you.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920
I'm from the Intelligence Bureau.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.640
I need to manage this level of observation.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.720
You said Jia Jia left her scarf here.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.200
She'll be back in two days.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.880
You have to pass it to her.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.760
It took her a long time to apply...

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.560
for a transfer back to Eastern District Hospital.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.640
She called me this morning.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.200
She should be home soon.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.519
It seems that this bowl of noodles...

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.799
won't be able to keep you, Inspector Tang.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800
Am I right?

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.880
She's my only sister.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.039
Officer Shi, I thought you only liked coffee.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.440
It turns out you like being jealous as well.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.400
And I thought you only liked work, Inspector Tang.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.600
It seems you also like making fun of me.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
Fine.

00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:03.040
The noodles can't make you stay.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.960
With this,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.520
I should be able to keep you here.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.920
What's this?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.960
I found it at the scene of Han Gang's accident.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240
Who gave it to you?

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.960
There's blood on it.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.320
Go investigate it.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
You should find something.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.520
Who gave it to you?

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.200
Are you going to eat the noodles or not?

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.480
I worked hard to cook it.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.880
Don't waste it if you're not going to eat it.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680
Anyway,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.240
the person who gave this to me...

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.520
has the same goal as you.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.520
You both want to find the real culprit.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.240
There's no conspiracy...

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.440
or any conflict of interest, okay?

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480
Hello, Jia Jia.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.280
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.879
I have something important...

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.960
to take care of tonight.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120
I'll see you at home later.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080
Get up.

00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:09.119
The car is here, Qin Yi Wei.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120
Get up.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.160
Hello, Judge Qin.

00:37:12.161 --> 00:37:13.560
I'm Yu Xin, the school basketball coach.

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.800
I called you just now.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.080
Hey.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080
Why are you so drunk?

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.560
It has nothing to do with Coach.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.960
I wanted to drink.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.440
Get in the car first.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.440
Come on.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.800
Be careful.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.799
Judge Qin, you might want to keep a closer eye on him.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.960
He just had an asthma attack.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.960
Alright, thank you.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.839
You know you have asthma,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.239
so why are you drinking?

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.320
It will irritate your windpipe.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.440
Yi Wei.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.920
I'm listening.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.880
After you drank,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.960
did you tell the coach anything?

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760
Tell her what?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.320
Something you shouldn't have.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.200
I didn't tell her anything.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400
Nothing at all.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.720
Don’t you have your asthma inhaler with you?

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.560
Judge Qin.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.719
Someone found a new piece of evidence...

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.880
at the scene of the accident.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040
It will be sent for bloodstain...

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.040
and DNA analysis.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120
Once we get the results,

00:39:06.121 --> 00:39:07.959
we'll be able to bring the culprit...

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.960
who hit Han Gang to justice.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280
Yi Wei.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.440
You can stop looking for it.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880
I know...

00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:12.080
who hit Han Gang.
