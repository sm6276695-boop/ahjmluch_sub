00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.840
Making us work so early in the morning.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.079
He's already dead.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:13.159
He can't run away.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.519
Master, you are mistaken.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.359
We must focus on the bigger picture.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.959
Yes, yes, the bigger picture.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:19.599
Even a bun can't shut you up.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.519
General Huo, have one.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.480
I can't eat right now.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.560
I can eat.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.319
You can eat?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.439
Catch.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.799
I can eat it.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.079
Greetings, Second Young Master.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.200
Hello, Second Young Master.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920
Senior Brother, it smells great.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:42.680
What's wrong with you?

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.480
Second Young Master cares about the people and the nation.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.040
He is truly a blessing for Xuan City.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.680
Finding the source of Xuan City's strange illness

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.640
is urgent.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.799
How could I dare slack off?

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.799
Second Young Master works too hard.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.120
You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.040
Have a bun.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.280
No need.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.480
I have no appetite.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.480
You should eat even if you have no appetite.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.200
You need to eat to have energy for work.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.200
Have one, have one.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.039
The City Lord actually entrusted such an important task

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.400
to someone like this.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.840
Heâ€™s not worthy of being called a master.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.919
Zhu Sheng.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.919
Strange.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.719
What's wrong, Senior Brother?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.840
On Minister Hu's body

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.599
there are clear bite marks.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.840
But no scratch marks.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.479
This doesn't seem like the work of Rotten People.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.599
And in the middle of the night,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.039
Minister Hu alone

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.560
went out to the wilderness for what?

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.080
Are there any houses near the crime scene?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.639
The crime scene is outside the city.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.919
No one lives nearby.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680
But there is an inn not far away.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.840
What do you think, Senior Brother?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Do you see anything?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.639
I don't have X-ray vision.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.759
How else can I look?

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.520
The riddle Master gave us

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.360
points to the west.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.360
The west.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.719
And right now we are

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.120
near the west side of Xuan City.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.599
It's deserted all around here.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.759
Yet there's an inn here.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.719
There must be something wrong.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.360
So,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.560
should we

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.120
ask General Huo and Second Young Master to go in with us?

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.879
If we really run into something,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.639
we could be in real danger.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.800
And little Zhu Sheng too.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.520
Let's call him as well.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.400
Enough.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.439
Too many people will alert them.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.599
Besides,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.400
we're new faces in Xuan City.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.599
It'll be easier for us to act.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.040
This kid is really pale.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.720
I don't even know where to start.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.000
Where should I start?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.519
You pervert, don't touch me!

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:29.959
Sir, please show some respect.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.759
May I ask where we are?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.319
Welcome to the Underground Paradise.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.399
From today on,

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.399
I will be your master.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.319
Understand?

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:45.920
Ugh, you pervert!

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.000
Senior Brother!

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.000
Senior Brother!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.120
Senior Brother!

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.519
What are you doing?

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:11.079
Everyone caught and brought here

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:13.279
will be carefully transformed by me.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.759
You'll be surprised.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.120
After being turned into deformities,

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.000
you'll be completely reborn.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.560
And shine in your new form.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800
You'll entertain guests with drinks and fun.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
Isn't that exciting?

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.600
However,

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.360
you two aren't exactly top quality.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.920
You're just low-grade.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.319
Just like him.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.079
What do you mean?

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.240
Disguise Art.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.519
I get that.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.560
Sir, the two of us

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.800
are quite satisfied with our looks.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.399
How about you let us go,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.639
and I'll find you

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.680
ten or so ugly people instead?

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.680
They can be transformed.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.600
That way,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.279
your skills will really shine.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.279
Yes, exactly!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.160
We're terrible at serving guests.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.399
We'll only ruin your business.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:00.720
Don't worry.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.959
Not everyone makes it that far.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.639
First, pass the first test.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.120
What's the first test?

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.560
Dismemberment.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.560
Pick one.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.480
Two more Money Trees for us.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.800
A Wu, you're really capable.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.759
A Wu, open the door.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.079
Do you have an invitation, sir?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240
What invitation?

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:28.439
I've got plenty of this.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.319
Only guests with invitations

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.680
can enter here.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.079
We have important guests today.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.600
No walk-ins allowed.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.399
That's a shame.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.000
But I came here in high spirits.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.600
You wouldn't just send me away, would you?

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.120
I've traveled far and wide.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.319
Been with countless beauties.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.319
But only

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.680
this girl's wild nature catches my eye.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.360
Madam,

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:07.639
sell her to me.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.920
Name your price.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.319
Her?

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.240
I'm afraid you can't handle her.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.919
A Wu.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.440
Cut off all three of his legs.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.399
Stop wasting my time.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:56.879
Have you chosen?

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.559
Want me to pick for you?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:00.840
How about this one?

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.639
Senior Brother, I'm scared.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.279
Senior Brother!

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.759
Good taste, let's go with this one.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.080
Sir,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.320
it seems the two of us

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.840
are doomed to die here today.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.279
Then let me tell you a secret.

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:18.159
A secret?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.080
Actually,

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.639
I've got silver notes hidden in my boot.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:23.240
They're all yours.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:26.159
Just spare us some suffering.

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.440
No problem, no problem.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.919
If only you'd said so earlier.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:31.679
Wait.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.159
My feet really stink.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.919
Most people can't stand it.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:40.000
Why don't you untie me,

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:41.600
and I'll give it to you?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.960
Trying to trick me?

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.600
You think my smart head

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.720
is just for show?

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:53.799
Let go!

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:54.480
Let me go!

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.440
Senior Brother, be careful!

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:24.799
No.

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.240
Let's talk this out.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:26.799
Brother,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.320
none of us will die today.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.840
I was just a farmer from East Village.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.720
I was deceived by these villains.

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:40.000
They gave me cat eyes.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.000
And put a hump on my back.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.440
Turned me into this monster.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.320
I see.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.399
Thank you for your trouble.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.080
I can't undo this.

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.080
Why?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.240
All the business here

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.919
is run by Madam Yu alone.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.240
She's extremely cautious.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.279
All the maps and keys

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.440
are kept by her alone.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.720
So...

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:12.279
They capture people and bring them here.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.440
They dismember and reassemble living people.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.000
If anyone survives,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.440
they're kept for others' amusement.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:22.759
And they make huge profits.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.240
They're truly inhuman.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.000
What about those who don't survive?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.200
I don't know the details.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.440
I've only heard they're collected for something else.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.960
Probably used for other purposes.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.039
Senior Brother,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.799
this place is too creepy.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.679
Let's get out of here.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.240
Wait.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:46.919
The smell in this cave

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.519
is just like on the day of the Fire God Festival.

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.279
It smells like the monsters.

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:52.679
Could it be...

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:53.840
Could it be...

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.600
Trying to escape, are you?

00:11:58.559 --> 00:11:59.399
A Wu!

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.840
We're doomed now.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.919
A Wu is in charge here.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.159
They went to great lengths to hire him as a guard.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:08.440
Every move is deadlyâ€”he's fast and ruthless.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:10.039
He's never failed.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.279
Senior Brother, what do we do?

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:16.519
Run!

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:25.840
Hunchback, you go first.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.759
Go find General Huo.

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:27.799
Leave this to us.

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:28.279
Go, go!

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:28.799
Hero,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.159
I won't let you down.

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:31.879
You witch!

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.879
Today we'll settle all our old and new scores!

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.639
New grudges?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.080
Old hatreds?

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.039
You know me?

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.440
Who am I?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.480
Stop pretending to be clueless.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.480
Beat us first, then we'll talk.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.159
Senior Brother!

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.879
You truly are the pride of our sect.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.799
Given our current state,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.720
how confident are you we can beat her?

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:54.320
Ten percent.
