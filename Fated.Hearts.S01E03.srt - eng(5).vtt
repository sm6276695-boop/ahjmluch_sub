00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.009
[Episode 3]

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.050
What do you think, Prime Minister?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.120
Shouldn't I kill him?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.710
Your Majesty.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.590
He deserves to be executed for
attempted assassination of the First Prince.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.630
I also believe that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.910
the First Prince won’t make things up.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.510
Since he has pleaded guilty,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.079
I think

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.360
he must be involved.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.820
You're making it sound so simple.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.190
He is your adopted son.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.280
He is just an outer disciple

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.750
of the Zhuang family.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.360
I only took him as my adopted son

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.530
so that I wouldn't die alone in old age.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.680
Alas,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.600
an adopted son is still adopted.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.490
If he really took me as his father,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.680
he wouldn't have done such

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.320
treasonous acts behind my back!

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.550
Your Majesty,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.910
I failed to teach my son well.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.910
I deserve to die!

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.630
Since you said so,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.190
it seems that

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.810
I did not kill the innocent.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.360
It seems like Her Majesty

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.520
has foresight.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.760
The fifth day of May is a good day.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.590
Second Brother has reached adulthood,
a cause to celebrate,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.680
while I have also caught

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.540
a spy from the Battle of Pingling,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.960
and can finally

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.329
answer to Your Majesty.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.680
The Second Prince is here.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.800
I have just finished
my coming-of-age ceremony,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.000
and as per etiquette,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.700
I'm here to pay my respects to you,
Mother.

[Empress of Susha Kingdom, Zhuang Jingyuan]

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.240
Get up.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.000
The coming-of-age ceremony
is already over?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.960
Brother is back.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.310
He said that he had something important
to discuss with Father,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.520
so I came back early.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.829
Nothing should be important enough

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.920
to disturb your coming-of-age ceremony.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.070
Brother has said that

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.000
he will

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.600
make it up to me in the future.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.430
You may leave.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.480
Yes.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.600
Come.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.480
Today is your coming-of-age ceremony.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.750
I prepared a gift for you.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.700
This book

[Qian Ruoshui]

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.600
records all the details of

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.480
all the civil and military ministers.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.670
Those whom your Father deeply trusts,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.370
[Zhao Shidao]

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.240
those whom are in relations
with the Zhuang,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.870
and those whom you need
to build relations with.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.600
I have ordered people

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.850
to record it down with detail.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.750
Now, you're all grown up.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.480
You must do your best

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.270
to help your Father.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.480
Help Father?

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.430
Brother is enough for that.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.060
I

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.870
just want to practice swordsmanship.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.070
So that in the future,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.290
I can be like Brother

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.880
and become a brave hero.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.230
Mother, look.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.240
This is

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.270
the coming-of-age ceremony gift
that Brother gave me.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.240
He's got you so satisfied

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.270
with just a sword.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.260
How many times have I told you?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.190
Your Brother is a deep thinker.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.950
You two aren't from the same womb.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.750
You mustn't get too close to him.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.320
Brother is not that kind of person.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.040
He is brave, good at fighting,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.560
and

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.250
he's an upright man.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.270
He's a great hero in my heart!

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.120
I'm telling you this

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.630
for your own good.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.560
You and the First Prince are different.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.390
The better he treats you,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.120
the more you should be careful.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.409
Understand?

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.240
Yes.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.560
Mother,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.240
if there's nothing else,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.210
I'm going to practice my swordsmanship.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.190
Must you choose the day
of your Brother's coming-of-age ceremony

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.360
to spill blood?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.110
What are you up to?

What is Her Majesty

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.240
up to?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.970
How dare you!

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.240
I have never

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.120
asked you to be biased towards me.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.350
But everything should be reasonable.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.240
The treacherous minister
wants to harm me,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.770
but yet you are not enraged.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.430
I as a prince
killed a treacherous minister,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.030
but Father wants to blame me.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.920
Are you still making excuses
in front of me?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.409
Since Father wants to blame me,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.720
how about this?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.390
You should just

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.870
stab me in the chest with an arrow

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.920
right now to give my life

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.600
for the one that I took.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.360
How about it?

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.120
Enough.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.800
How inappropriate you are!

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.160

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.720
used to wandering outside.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.190
You don't even know how
to behave in front of me now.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.240
I've been like this

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.510
since I was a child.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.690
Since you're injured,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.880
I'll let it slide for now.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.740
Can I leave now?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.330
There's a banquet tonight.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.720
You can show up

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.160

Maybe another day.

how he wants to be closer to you.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.190
If you don't show up,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.480
he will be disappointed.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.730
I'll make it up to him another day.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.310
But not today.

out of kindness.

you predicted it correctly.

As expected, the people at Jinxiu

are searching for Fu Yixiao.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:46.510
I know.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.120
This is my responsibility.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.240
Being born in the royal family,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.400
everyone has

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.970
their own responsibility.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.370
But I just want to live for myself once.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.400
Even if it's just once.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.350
Brother,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.240
you're the only one
I can have this conversation with.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.300
You won't find me bothersome, do you?

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.240
Silly girl.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.030
I'm your Brother.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.680
Even if I do I'd still have to listen.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.720
Since you are my Brother.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.590
You have to endure my hits.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.250
No dodging!

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.120
No dodging!

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.960
It hurts.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.070
Are you okay?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.400
All right.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.390
You're right.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.270
No one in the royal family
hasn't been wronged.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.070
But I fought hard during battles

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.750
and made great achievements

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.330
just to make sure

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.420
you don't suffer.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.410
Don't worry.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.720
I will remember

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.880
what you said.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.750
All right, you may leave.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:16.590
Yes.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.000
Although He'er is an adopted son,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.240
he is still a Zhuang.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.340
This Feng Suige

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.510
is so unbridled that

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.290
he dare kill him in public?

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.410
At this point,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:33.720
there's no point in speaking of it.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.180
It's just a pity for He'er.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.680
He did look

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.580
somewhat similar do Jingheng.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.960
I didn't expect that

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.060
he couldn't live past thirty as well.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.310
It was Chengyang's coming-of-age ceremony

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.000
and yet he spilled blood in court.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.860
Looks like

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.790
he's targeting the Zhuang family soon.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.680
He's no longer the kid

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.880
that only knows how to cry 15 years ago.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.090
You shouldn't have

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.550
arranged Chengyang's
coming-of-age ceremony

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.680
of the fifth of May

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.200
just for a moment of satisfaction.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.990
You should have listened to me

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.750
and gotten rid of Feng Suige early on.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.830
Then something like this

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.070
wouldn't have happened.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.920
A young prince

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.400
can't cause any trouble.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.410
If a young prince

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.570
died in the palace,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680
His Majesty would've

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.440
started to suspect

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.550
me and you.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.270
Your Highness's swordsmanship

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.480
has improved a lot.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.350
Thanks to the sword Brother gave me.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.930
If not for the years of endurance,

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.770
there wouldn't be Chengyang today.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.880
So,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.760
we can't rush it.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.660
Feng Suige is the eldest son.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.880
Now he's of the age to get married.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.790
Once he gets married and has children,

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.020
it's only a matter of time before he gets his title.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.720
Along with his outstanding military achievements…

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720
So you think that

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.150
he's the best candidate?

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.680
As long as Feng Suige is alive,

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.740
how can Chengyang ascend the throne?

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.000
I am willing to obey

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.350
whatever you decide, Father.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.150
But right now,

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.720
we can't wait any longer.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.080
The Jinxiu marriage
proposal will arrive soon.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.190
Make preparations

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.570
for Xiyang to marry into their court.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.020
Father...

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.290
Father, what do you mean by this?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.880
What happened before
has nothing to do with you.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.940
Don't ask further.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.240
May Your Majesty enjoy health and peace.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.680
I'll take my leave.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.580
Feng Suige,

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.310
you locked me up here.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.990
What exactly do you want?

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.420
Looks like you've recovered well.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.820
You've got strength now.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:04.730
Answer me.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.160
I spared your life

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.910
and let you stay here

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.200
not so you could recover

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.140
and then cry for my blood.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:10.980
I told you

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.860
I don't remember anything.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.670
Don't waste your efforts on me.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:16.510
If you can't remember, then forget it.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.830
At least you
still have your martial skills.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.960
It would be a pity if you died.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.240
My left hand is crippled.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.030
Still enough
to throw an inkstone at me, isn't it?

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.890
That's enough.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.700
I'll find someone

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.900
to heal that arm.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:25.510
No need.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.810
This is no charity hall.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.200
I spared you

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.960
because I have conditions.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.400
Finally getting to the point.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.720
What conditions?

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.480
From this day on,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.080
serve me, body and soul.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.450
Keep dreaming.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.960
Serve me, and you live.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.240
Refuse, and you die.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.750
Looks to me

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.610
like you don't have many choices.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.150
Fu Yixiao,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.310
though there are

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.640
no weapons in this room,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.960
there are plenty of sharp objects.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.590
If you truly wanted to die,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.110
you've had ample opportunity.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.550
But instead of seeking death,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.960
you stayed here waiting for me.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.090
That means you've thought it through.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.030
You know your only chance

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.390
to uncover the truth

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.640
is to join forces with me.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.910
If you want cooperation,

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.110
at least prepare good wine and food.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.070
Why are you so interested

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.200
in who wants me dead?

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.850
Doesn't seem

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.240
to concern you.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.440
If you won't speak honestly,

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.880
you're clearly not sincere.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.180
My enemy colluded with Jinxiu

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.380
to set me up.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.550
And the traitor

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.200
is likely the same person in Jinxiu

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.260
who wants you dead.

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.420
I need your help

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.160
to find a clue to his betrayal,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.220
uncover evidence,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.440
take him down,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.790
and kill him.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.750
You saw it with your own eyes

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.150
when we entered the city.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.590
There are people
in Susha who want me dead.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.810
People who want to eliminate me.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.000
And you,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.770
a decorated warrior on the battlefield,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.380
betrayed by your own.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.400
Aren't we the same?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.830
You and I were meant

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.270
to share in each other's sorrow.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.160
I see now.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.200
You just want to use me

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.100
to kill for you.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.120
Why should I help you?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.940
Don't call it help.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.770
And don't say I'm using you.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.960
Call it mutual benefit.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.040
Is that so?

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.390
Let's hear it.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:43.890
Your left hand is useless.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.590
Even if

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.590
you found the one who wants you dead,

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.240
you couldn't take them down alone.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.640
And you've lost your memory,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.920
with no leads and no clues.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920
Even if your killer

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.160
were standing right in front of you,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.910
you wouldn't be able to tell.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.350
But I

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.510
have men.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.640
I have means.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.160
You could use me.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.290
Just say what you want.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.070
No need to pretend
you're doing this for me.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.200
I've already done the thinking for you.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.590
Saves you the trouble.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.430
Don't forget

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.720
we're enemies.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.590
Aren't you seeking revenge?

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.050
If you agree to cooperate,

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.030
our past grievances are erased.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.950
Never to be mentioned again.

go just because you said so?

While my people

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.760
clash with them,

you reap the rewards.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.400
Two gains with one move.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.560
But have you considered it?

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:46.970
This is Susha.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.660
My spies are everywhere.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.320
Even if

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.300
they dared follow,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.960
they wouldn't get close.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.090
Your plan may fall apart.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.840
But no worries.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.710
I can

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.320
help you catch them.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.390
No need.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.810
You just agreed to cooperate.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.360
Now you want to back out?

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.800
Your face,

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.580
half smiling,

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.740
half scheming.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.540
Just like you,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.070
part righteous, part wicked.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.230
Impossible to read.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.440
Is there anyone

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.330
in this world who truly understands you?

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.550
You think you can see through me?

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.150
Seems those around you

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.550
don't know you at all.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.930
Then again,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.360
someone like you

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.360
probably doesn't have many friends.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.920
If you want to understand me that badly,

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.150
fine.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.360
Go ahead.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.240
Take a good look.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.200
As long as my arrow

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.780
can pierce through here,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.400
I don't need to understand you.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:56.400
Agreed.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:57.880
All we need

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.440
is cooperation.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.480
Understanding or not, does it matter?

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.030
Let's place a bet.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.280
Let's bet

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:07.030
that I can become a partner

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:09.280
you can truly rely on.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.190
Do you dare?

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.030
Why wouldn't I?

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.640
Why didn't you act earlier?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840
His Lordship said

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.920
it's best if Fu Yixiao

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.150
dies by Feng Suige's hand.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.840
If Feng Suige really wanted to kill her,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.250
he would've done it at the post station.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.670
Why bring her all the way to Yujing?

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.830
This is Susha.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.920
To strike

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.020
under Feng Suige's watch,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.070
[Time is running out.
You must get rid of Fu Yixiao.]

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.400
we only have one chance.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.510
[Fu Yixiao is skilful.
You must plan carefully.]

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.550
To hit the mark,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.130
we must wait patiently.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.510
His Lordship also said

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.960
reinforcements are on their way.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.520
We must not act rashly.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.360
If we alert the enemy,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.800
we'll lose our only shot.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.590
You...

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.410
I'll cooperate.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.320
But I have my conditions.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:00.800
Speak.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.800
First,

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.800
I will never do anything

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.000
to harm Jinxiu.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.320
If you want me to betray them,

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.510
you'll have to kill me.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.000
Agreed.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.110
Second,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.290
if we uncover the person behind it all,

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.000
I'll interrogate them myself.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.710
You must not hide anything from me.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.310
Of course.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.360
Third,

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.110
I can go whenever I want.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.680
You must not stop me.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.410
In addition to that,

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.000
I'll find someone

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.530
to treat your injured hand,

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.480
so you can defend yourself.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.670
It's a deal.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.110
A deal.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.770
We're even

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.030
now.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.250
What are you doing?

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.440
Why so anxious?

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.280
There's still one more debt to settle.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.570

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.130

♪ Yet I chanced upon you

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.320
What kind of play is this?

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:32.870
Come.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.030
-Turn around.
-Don't look.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.540
Don't look. Don't look.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.000
Now we're truly even.

[Wutong Mansion]

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.050
Why are you smiling?

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.530
I'm not.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.720
You clearly smiled.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.590
Did I?

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:18.280
But I saw you smile.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.920
There's nothing to be happy about.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.920
Why would I smile?

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.720
See? You're smiling again.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.440
Come in.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.070
[To the Marshal: Our forces retreated
from Pingling City to the eastern woods,]

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.000
You all think that we lost

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.550
[where we were ambushed by the Zhennan
Army, numbering over 1,000.]

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.810
the Battle of Pingling

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.030
because Fu Yixiao

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.400
shot me with an arrow.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.400
But have you ever considered

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.280
why Jinxiu was able to immediately

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.800
mobilize their troops

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.860
and launch a massive counterattack?

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.920
And they attacked from both flanks,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.150
surrounding us on three sides.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.190
They even knew

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.030
our retreat route

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.230
perfectly.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.750
At these three strategic passes,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.280
Jinxiu had already planted ambushes

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.940
before the battle even began.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.600
Your Highness, are you saying

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.510
Jinxiu knew from the start

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.570
that we would lose?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.930
That's impossible.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.440
If you hadn't taken that arrow,

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.550
we would've captured

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:11.920
Zhennan Pass...

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.360
No.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.960
If we had taken Zhennan Pass,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.760
our next move
would've been to march into the city.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.510
The fact that Jinxiu was able to

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.150
mobilize all forces

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.150
instantly

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:19.280
proves that the city

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.280
was already heavily fortified.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280
If we had entered,

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.110
they only needed to close the gates,

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:23.840
and our entire army

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.630
would've been
slaughtered with no burial ground.
