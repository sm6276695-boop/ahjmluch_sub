00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:48.334
That's right. Beautiful.

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:49.634
There you go.

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:51.614
There! That's good!

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:52.814
Nice.

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:53.934
Try turning the flowers this way.

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:55.174
Yep, like that.

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:55.614
There.

00:01:07.214 --> 00:01:09.254
You can play with your hands a little.

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:13.534
Is there anything you want to discuss?

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:15.254
Your fiancÃ©

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:17.134
got my friend pregnant.

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:19.334
What kind of oblivious, ignorant

00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:20.694
woman are you?

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.094
He's making a fool out of you, Doc.

00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:25.974
It's time to wake up
and smell the coffee.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:35.334
Gorgeous.

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:36.414
You got it.

00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:44.414
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:01:44.794 --> 00:01:46.254
The woman who's modeling there...

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:47.774
Who is she?

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:49.254
That's Miss Pat.

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:52.374
Pat Napak,
the queen of all villainesses out there,

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.414
the front-runner in the industry.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.334
If you'll excuse me.

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:03.774
"The villainess..."

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:17.974
Prem,

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:21.734
everyone is saying
terrible things about you.

00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:23.934
They say you're an awful woman,

00:02:24.074 --> 00:02:25.654
so he left you for someone else.

00:02:26.214 --> 00:02:28.334
Do you agree with them, Father?

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:29.574
Prem!

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:32.054
Darling, please calm down.

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:36.955
Prem,

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.294
I understand you.

00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:43.574
You do understand us, don't you?

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:51.254
I don't want anything to happen
to my perfect daughter's reputation.

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:52.934
I think...

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:56.774
you should find a way
to clear things up, dear.

00:02:57.054 --> 00:02:59.654
I never want
to be caught up in any of this, Mother.

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:05.134
But I can't control
what anyone thinks, Father.

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:07.614
You ungrateful daughter!

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.334
Out of the frying pan
and straight into the fire.

00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:33.254
After our wedding,

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.654
where do you wanna go for our honeymoon?

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:37.334
To the beach.

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:45.654
[Thawat]

00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:40.175
What the hell are you doing?!

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:41.503
- Let go!
- No!

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:42.894
Why are you gripping me?

00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:44.214
I'm helping you!

00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:45.134
Helping?

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:48.174
I'm saving you from jumping to your death.

00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:51.414
I wasn't trying to jump into that water!

00:04:51.454 --> 00:04:52.974
I dropped my bracelet,

00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:54.374
so I was just looking for it!

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:56.774
Leave me alone!

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.174
What now?

00:05:01.214 --> 00:05:02.694
- Let go of me!
- No way.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.454
How could I even be sure
you won't take your own life again?

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:07.734
Hands off!

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:08.694
Never.

00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:11.014
- Let me go!
- No!

00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:20.826
Get up!

00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:23.374
Why so bitter?

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.574
We know each other, don't we?

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:28.174
I don't recall ever knowing you!

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:30.154
Well, well,

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:31.494
you forgot about me?

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:34.014
I'm the person
who saved you from that bastard.

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:35.794
"Saved"?

00:05:36.394 --> 00:05:37.394
Yes!

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.374
If it weren't for me,

00:05:39.534 --> 00:05:42.934
you wouldn't even know
your man was sleeping with the other woman

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:45.494
and becoming a father.

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.134
If you really wanted to help,

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:51.174
you would've said it properly,

00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:52.974
thought it through properly,

00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:55.454
and treated me properly!

00:05:55.734 --> 00:05:58.454
I think I did it just like you described.

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:01.614
Ow!

00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:06.694
Think whatever you'd like.

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:08.334
Just go our separate ways...

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:09.774
Is that clear?

00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:52.654
[Bow]

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.254
Hey, Bow.

00:06:57.414 --> 00:06:58.694
Prem, where have you been?

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:00.254
I've been calling so much
my fingers are numb.

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:02.374
I was sick of the calls,

00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:03.574
so I turned off my phone.

00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:07.207
You mean Thawat's calls, right?

00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:08.334
Mm,

00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:10.054
he's been blowing up my phone.

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:12.974
Well, since he can't get a hold of you,

00:07:13.134 --> 00:07:14.854
he comes to wait at the hospital.

00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:17.174
Did you tell him where I am?

00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:18.654
I'd never do that,

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.534
even though he tried to pry my mouth open.

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:21.974
Thanks, Bow.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:26.574
Please cover for me in the meantime.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:28.974
I'll be back in a few days.

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:31.174
Take all the time you need to feel better.

00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:32.814
No need to worry.

00:07:33.174 --> 00:07:34.014
Mm...

00:08:00.134 --> 00:08:01.014
Prem!

00:08:03.614 --> 00:08:05.934
Oh, Wut, Non!

00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:09.454
It's really nice to see you.

00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:12.414
Are you drinking by yourself?

00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:13.174
Yes,

00:08:13.814 --> 00:08:14.774
I am.

00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:20.388
Are you still working at...

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.395
RAM2 Hospital?

00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:22.374
Mm-hm,

00:08:22.774 --> 00:08:23.894
I still work there.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.894
Are there only two of you here today?

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:28.694
Nope,

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:30.534
we got the whole gang.

00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:33.057
Wut...

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.454
dragged us here
for his girlfriend's birthday surprise.

00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:37.494
You have a girlfriend now, Wut?

00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:39.313
That's right.

00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:42.014
Who?

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.054
It's Peam, his enemy.

00:08:44.694 --> 00:08:47.374
Didn't you tell me you hated her guts?

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.894
What gives?

00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:50.174
I don't know.

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:53.574
All I know is that...
Peam and I are now in love.

00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:55.414
From enemies...

00:08:55.614 --> 00:08:57.134
to lovers?

00:08:57.534 --> 00:08:58.774
I guess so.

00:08:58.814 --> 00:09:01.414
Is it even possible

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:03.254
to go from hating each other

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.414
to falling completely in love?

00:09:05.674 --> 00:09:09.334
Love is unpredictable.

00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:11.254
Love is love.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.334
There's no reason

00:09:14.614 --> 00:09:15.614
why you love someone.

00:09:18.134 --> 00:09:19.214
Right, dude?

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:21.014
- Yep...
- That's what he told me.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:23.854
Wow,

00:09:24.134 --> 00:09:25.434
how romantic.

00:09:25.574 --> 00:09:27.214
If you find the right person,

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:28.334
your gut will tell you.

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.534
Your heart's gonna beat like crazy.

00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:31.974
Have you been there?

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:41.694
I'm not sure...

00:09:43.234 --> 00:09:44.614
Anyway,

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:48.614
cheers to your new love, Wut.

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.054
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

00:09:56.414 --> 00:09:58.134
- Thank you, Prem.
- Mm.

00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:00.854
We gotta go now.

00:10:01.274 --> 00:10:02.654
Let's all go grab a bite later.

00:10:03.054 --> 00:10:04.014
See you.

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:05.374
- Let's go, dude.
- See you later.

00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.534
Didn't you understand what I said?

00:10:20.894 --> 00:10:22.361
Is this your go-to drink, Doc?

00:10:23.734 --> 00:10:24.854
Excuse me,

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:27.494
one Mimi, DoULoveMe

00:10:27.534 --> 00:10:29.854
and one classic pink gin, please.

00:10:29.894 --> 00:10:30.894
Right away.

00:10:32.754 --> 00:10:34.254
Can I treat you to this

00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:35.494
so that we can be even?

00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:36.974
Don't bother.

00:10:37.494 --> 00:10:38.494
Aw,

00:10:38.774 --> 00:10:40.294
so you're an unforgiving one?

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.734
Just leave.

00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:45.854
I'd like to be alone.

00:10:52.334 --> 00:10:52.814
Here you go.

00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:56.174
Frankly, I'm not the type
to ask for forgiveness.

00:10:56.654 --> 00:10:58.694
Then, what exactly do you want from me?

00:10:59.414 --> 00:11:01.814
Why are you bothering me?

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:02.974
I want you.

00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:07.054
Can we please start over?

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:10.254
I might be way too straightforward

00:11:10.974 --> 00:11:12.054
and unpleasant sometimes,

00:11:12.374 --> 00:11:14.094
but please don't hold it against me.

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:17.414
Everything I did
was out of good intentions.

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:25.614
To be honest,

00:11:25.654 --> 00:11:27.454
what you did to me

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:29.936
was not easily forgivable.

00:11:30.414 --> 00:11:31.574
But...

00:11:35.014 --> 00:11:37.334
I can't deny that I benefited from it.

00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:40.134
So you're not mad at me anymore, Doc?

00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:41.654
Deep down, I know

00:11:41.974 --> 00:11:44.454
that the one
ruining my wedding wasn't you.

00:11:45.294 --> 00:11:47.134
You were just igniting the flame.

00:11:47.294 --> 00:11:48.454
But it's better

00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:50.454
that you don't show your face to me.

00:11:51.494 --> 00:11:53.974
I don't want to be
around someone who messed up my life.

00:12:03.254 --> 00:12:04.574
Wait, Doc!

00:12:35.134 --> 00:12:36.134
Where's my keycard?

00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:44.894
You're back, Doc?

00:12:47.494 --> 00:12:49.814
How are you gonna pay
for Marc dumping me?

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:54.734
What does that have to do with me?

00:12:55.254 --> 00:12:56.854
I didn't do anything to your boyfriend.

00:12:57.094 --> 00:12:59.094
He was the one coming for me.

00:12:59.434 --> 00:13:01.134
If you weren't seducing him,

00:13:01.494 --> 00:13:02.654
then why would he come to you?

00:13:02.934 --> 00:13:04.094
Sorry,

00:13:05.314 --> 00:13:06.854
but I'm not into men.

00:13:07.414 --> 00:13:08.734
What do you even mean?

00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:11.974
Are you saying you're into women?

00:13:12.774 --> 00:13:13.774
Liar!

00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:15.454
You? Into women?

00:13:15.654 --> 00:13:17.214
I've only seen you with guys on the news.

00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:19.854
You believe those tabloid stories?

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:23.494
Are you smart enough for the Internet?

00:13:24.334 --> 00:13:25.174
Hey,

00:13:25.694 --> 00:13:29.194
or maybe you swing both ways?

00:13:30.454 --> 00:13:32.174
Are you gonna feel anything for me now?

00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:33.334
I have standards.

00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:34.014
You!

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:36.614
Girl, just step back.

00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:38.854
Don't breathe the same air as freaks,

00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:41.014
or you'll catch their sickness.

00:13:42.574 --> 00:13:43.854
You talk trash

00:13:44.154 --> 00:13:45.214
and behave like trash.

00:13:45.614 --> 00:13:47.974
You're worthless.

00:13:48.374 --> 00:13:49.894
No wonder you got dumped.

00:13:50.054 --> 00:13:50.734
Hey!

00:13:57.094 --> 00:13:58.414
Assaulting...

00:13:58.594 --> 00:13:59.814
equals jail time.

00:14:00.254 --> 00:14:01.614
This is none of your business.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.774
Unless you're her kind?

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:06.174
You touched me, didn't you?

00:14:06.474 --> 00:14:08.294
Am I gonna catch your sickness?!

00:14:11.054 --> 00:14:13.094
I don't know which cave
you've been hiding in,

00:14:13.334 --> 00:14:16.414
but homosexuality is neither a disease

00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:18.574
nor contagious.

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:25.694
I filmed everything.

00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:28.334
If you wanna be a clown
on social media, go ahead.

00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:31.294
With that homophobic attitude of yours,

00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:33.254
you're gonna get canceled in no time.

00:14:37.494 --> 00:14:38.414
Let's go.

00:14:54.774 --> 00:14:55.774
What a bitch!

00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:06.814
Is that it?

00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:09.414
Want me to hold it
all the way to your room?

00:15:11.254 --> 00:15:12.974
I'd love that.

00:15:14.894 --> 00:15:16.654
Thank you for your help.

00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:18.974
No need to thank me.

00:15:19.414 --> 00:15:21.054
I would've done the same for anyone.

00:15:23.454 --> 00:15:26.374
You didn't actually record anything,
did you?

00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:27.974
If you'll excuse me.

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:30.294
Wait, Doc.

00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:47.094
Good night, Doc.

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:35.694
What a foolish thing to do.

00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:41.688
It's good that you're feeling better.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:45.974
I think I found someone
who makes my heart beat faster than Nam.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.094
Who?

00:16:50.694 --> 00:16:51.694
I'm hanging up.

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:47.294
â«You make my heart flutterâ«

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:51.654
â«You make me melt
every time you lean closerâ«

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:56.374
â«Your gaze makes me lose my mindâ«

00:17:56.614 --> 00:18:01.174
â«You're the only one I want by my sideâ«

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:02.974
â«I can say I'm second to noneâ«

00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:05.694
â«I can treat you better than anyoneâ«

00:18:05.934 --> 00:18:07.654
â«All my love is for youâ«

00:18:07.694 --> 00:18:10.334
â«Only your commands I listen toâ«

00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:12.854
â«Come taste me, and you will seeâ«

00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:15.174
â«How much I want you, babyâ«

00:18:15.214 --> 00:18:19.574
â«What will it take for you to cave in?â«

00:18:19.614 --> 00:18:24.214
â«Let me be someone
you trust with your heartâ«

00:18:24.254 --> 00:18:28.654
â«I promise you're my one and onlyâ«

00:18:28.694 --> 00:18:30.654
â«Let yourself fall for meâ«

00:18:30.694 --> 00:18:36.094
â«Can you let me win at all, my baby?â«

00:18:37.374 --> 00:18:41.334
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

00:18:41.974 --> 00:18:45.854
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

00:18:46.614 --> 00:18:50.494
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

00:18:51.134 --> 00:18:54.774
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

00:18:54.814 --> 00:18:57.814
â«You can only fall for meâ«

00:19:00.254 --> 00:19:02.414
â«Only me, babyâ«

00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:11.854
â«You'll only fall for meâ«

00:19:26.054 --> 00:19:27.534
Hi, there, Doc.

00:19:27.974 --> 00:19:30.494
I forgot that I didn't introduce myself.

00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:32.134
My name is Pat,

00:19:32.694 --> 00:19:34.054
Dr. Premsinee.

00:19:38.214 --> 00:19:39.054
Hey,

00:19:39.694 --> 00:19:41.494
I thought I made myself clear enough.

00:19:41.774 --> 00:19:43.694
I want nothing to do with you.

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:46.174
But you saved me yesterday, Doc.

00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:49.174
I just thought I might return the favor.

00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:50.494
There's no need.

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:03.174
What are you doing?

00:20:04.534 --> 00:20:06.214
The more you move,
the more revealing it'll be.

00:20:12.454 --> 00:20:15.614
â«A forbidden love of two souls,â«

00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:19.174
â«The more I suppress,â«

00:20:19.214 --> 00:20:22.774
â«The more it unfoldsâ«

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:26.054
â«It's gonna cut deep, I knowâ«

00:20:26.754 --> 00:20:30.014
â«I'm not supposed to yield,â«

00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:33.455
â«But the closer to you, the more I feelâ«

00:20:33.495 --> 00:20:36.655
â«As much as I want to hide,â«

00:20:37.134 --> 00:20:40.294
â«I run back to your sightâ«

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:44.614
â«Heavenly, yet it's hell,â«

00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:47.534
With all that gazing,

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:50.694
I won't be able to control myself.

00:20:51.814 --> 00:20:54.934
â«No way to tear it apartâ«

00:20:54.974 --> 00:20:56.134
Are you blushing?

00:20:58.254 --> 00:20:59.094
No.

00:20:59.694 --> 00:21:01.254
Why would I blush for a woman?

00:21:01.614 --> 00:21:03.294
A woman like me

00:21:05.454 --> 00:21:07.374
can certainly make you blush.

00:21:08.334 --> 00:21:13.254
â«It's agonizing, yet alluringâ«

00:21:13.294 --> 00:21:17.934
â«Like the sweetest poison,â«

00:21:19.454 --> 00:21:21.454
Take better care of yourself next time.

00:21:21.494 --> 00:21:23.254
I can't always help you out.

00:21:23.294 --> 00:21:29.094
â«In the end, to you, I always turnâ«

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:37.894
â«Forbidden to the touch,
though the distance insists I mustâ«

00:21:37.934 --> 00:21:41.294
â«My desire can't be tamedâ«

00:21:41.334 --> 00:21:44.774
â«Like a moth to a flameâ«

00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:49.174
â«A tether meant to claim,
pulling on my soul,â«

00:21:49.214 --> 00:21:52.774
â«Chaining me tight, no matter where I goâ«

00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:54.574
â«A bitter love that stingsâ«

00:21:57.454 --> 00:21:59.214
See you in Bangkok, Doc!

00:21:59.254 --> 00:22:03.534
â«Heavenly, yet it's hell,â«

00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:06.974
â«Luring me before I fellâ«

00:22:07.014 --> 00:22:10.254
â«Into your loving realm,â«

00:22:10.294 --> 00:22:15.694
â«No way to tear it apartâ«

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:22.894
â«Like the thorns
that pierce through my heart,â«

00:22:23.614 --> 00:22:25.374
Good night, Doc.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.764
â«It's agonizing, yet alluringâ«

00:22:32.054 --> 00:22:36.934
â«Like the sweetest poison,â«

00:22:37.334 --> 00:22:41.814
â«The more I resist, the more I yearnâ«

00:22:41.854 --> 00:22:48.894
â«In the end, to you, I always turnâ«

00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:14.755
- Let me go!
- No!

00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:20.075
Get up!

00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:24.115
What are you doing?

00:23:26.355 --> 00:23:28.155
Her stubborn face

00:23:28.435 --> 00:23:29.835
is pretty cute.

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.315
Miss Pat,

00:23:38.635 --> 00:23:41.955
I put away all the stuff
from your beach trip.

00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:42.995
Thank you.

00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:44.755
When I cleaned your room earlier,

00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:47.475
I found this on your bed.

00:23:49.035 --> 00:23:49.875
Miss!

00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:56.675
Thank you again.

00:24:02.395 --> 00:24:04.795
Should I give this back to her?

00:24:08.435 --> 00:24:09.595
But if I do,

00:24:10.835 --> 00:24:12.955
she'll know I was the person
from that night.

00:24:13.475 --> 00:24:15.075
Should I not give it back?

00:24:25.995 --> 00:24:26.755
Pat?

00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:28.965
Pat, are you in there?

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.315
Open the door for me.

00:24:30.995 --> 00:24:31.795
Pat!

00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:35.075
Pat!

00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:36.315
Pat!

00:24:47.915 --> 00:24:49.435
Why did you change the keycard?

00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:51.995
Why can't I? It's my own place.

00:24:52.315 --> 00:24:53.555
You've changed, Pat.

00:24:53.835 --> 00:24:55.715
You've never been like this.

00:24:55.955 --> 00:24:57.275
Who's changed exactly?

00:24:58.555 --> 00:25:00.435
Are you still mad at me, Pat?

00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:04.435
I'm sorry I was a bit
harsh on you that day.

00:25:04.755 --> 00:25:05.755
Forget it.

00:25:06.435 --> 00:25:07.675
I'm not mad.

00:25:07.955 --> 00:25:10.035
Then, why haven't you
been answering my calls?

00:25:12.835 --> 00:25:15.395
Because I want you to sort yourself out.

00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:18.315
Has that man taken you and the baby in?

00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:23.075
He said he was still
gonna marry that woman.

00:25:25.595 --> 00:25:27.395
There's nothing I can do, Pat.

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:29.675
He doesn't pick up my calls at all.

00:25:35.315 --> 00:25:36.635
Don't worry, Nam.

00:25:37.635 --> 00:25:41.035
I'll make sure he never goes back to her.

00:25:42.435 --> 00:25:43.955
And how are you gonna do that?

00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:45.715
I have my ways.

00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:49.195
Pat...

00:25:49.995 --> 00:25:51.795
please stick with me.

00:25:51.835 --> 00:25:53.595
I have no one left.

00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:55.555
Please don't leave me, Pat.

00:25:56.515 --> 00:25:57.875
Promise me.

00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:06.995
Nam, just go home.

00:26:08.195 --> 00:26:09.315
I wanna get some rest.

00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:12.235
Let's talk later.

00:26:15.315 --> 00:26:16.515
Just go, Nam.

00:26:17.435 --> 00:26:18.515
I'm begging you.

00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:23.915
I'm heading out, then.

00:26:47.395 --> 00:26:50.795
"Dr. Premsinee Chotiphicharn,

00:26:50.835 --> 00:26:52.995
cardiac surgeon."

00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:57.875
I'll see you again, Doc.

00:27:16.275 --> 00:27:17.155
Pat,

00:27:17.675 --> 00:27:19.875
you scared me!

00:27:21.955 --> 00:27:23.875
Beautiful flowers for my beautiful mama.

00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.395
They're beautiful.

00:27:28.235 --> 00:27:29.435
Thank you, sweetie.

00:27:30.595 --> 00:27:33.275
What brings you here?

00:27:34.035 --> 00:27:35.475
Well...

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:39.075
I miss you, Mama!

00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:41.315
I really do!

00:27:42.195 --> 00:27:43.515
Where's Papa?

00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:46.275
He's at work, of course.

00:27:46.675 --> 00:27:49.275
Don't you have work to do?

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.135
Nope!

00:27:51.475 --> 00:27:53.715
My only work now is missing my mama.

00:27:55.235 --> 00:27:56.795
Don't be all affectionate now.

00:27:56.835 --> 00:27:58.395
What do you want?

00:27:59.955 --> 00:28:00.795
Ouch...

00:28:01.115 --> 00:28:02.875
there's nothing that I want.

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:05.555
I just wanna take you to a medical checkup.

00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:07.147
A medical checkup?

00:28:07.595 --> 00:28:09.475
Exactly!

00:28:10.035 --> 00:28:13.355
But my appointment is not any time soon.

00:28:13.555 --> 00:28:15.715
You don't have to wait for any of that.

00:28:15.755 --> 00:28:16.435
Come on.

00:28:16.735 --> 00:28:18.435
- Let's go, Mama.
- Just hold on a sec.

00:28:18.475 --> 00:28:21.035
Why would I go if I feel completely fine?

00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:22.395
Answer this:

00:28:22.435 --> 00:28:26.515
have you been feeling tired
or short of breath?

00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:28.195
Tired?

00:28:29.555 --> 00:28:31.155
I'm pretty tired, to be honest.

00:28:31.195 --> 00:28:32.195
There!

00:28:32.395 --> 00:28:34.715
I'll take you to a cardiologist.

00:28:35.035 --> 00:28:37.195
I don't have heart disease!

00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:39.235
Better safe than sorry, Mama!

00:28:39.275 --> 00:28:40.475
Let's go.

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:41.955
Wait, you mischievous girl.

00:28:42.395 --> 00:28:46.515
You have something planned, haven't you?

00:28:53.835 --> 00:28:54.955
Please come in.

00:29:09.275 --> 00:29:10.955
Hi, there, Dr. Premsinee.

00:29:14.235 --> 00:29:15.515
Hello, Auntie.

00:29:15.635 --> 00:29:16.795
Hello.

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:21.355
I was wondering which doctor
my daughter was taking me to.

00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:23.475
Turns out it's Dr. Premsinee.

00:29:25.675 --> 00:29:27.395
You know her, Mama?

00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:28.715
Of course.

00:29:28.755 --> 00:29:32.115
She is your dad's cardiologist!

00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:36.475
What a small world.

00:29:37.715 --> 00:29:38.715
How lovely.

00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:45.995
So you came in
because of the tightness in your chest?

00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:49.035
It's actually nothing.

00:29:49.075 --> 00:29:52.835
It was my daughter
who insisted I come.

00:29:53.755 --> 00:29:55.515
Mama feels tired.

00:29:56.475 --> 00:29:57.475
How exactly?

00:29:57.875 --> 00:29:59.715
When she walks.

00:30:00.035 --> 00:30:03.315
Is this enough to test for heart disease?

00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:05.155
Miss...

00:30:05.195 --> 00:30:06.715
It's Pat.

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:11.235
Right, Miss Pat.

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:13.675
I'm talking to the patient.

00:30:13.715 --> 00:30:15.315
But I'm the patient's daughter.

00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:16.515
I can tell you what she has.

00:30:16.555 --> 00:30:18.155
Pat!

00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:20.595
Be polite to the doctor!

00:30:20.635 --> 00:30:21.635
Don't be such a pain.

00:30:25.635 --> 00:30:30.475
Then, to give Miss... Pat peace of mind,

00:30:31.315 --> 00:30:33.395
I'll send the patient for a thorough exam.

00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:36.955
I'm ordering a chest X-ray,

00:30:37.155 --> 00:30:39.035
an EKG,

00:30:39.155 --> 00:30:41.355
an echo, and an EST

00:30:41.395 --> 00:30:45.875
to check your heart function
and look for any abnormalities.

00:30:47.155 --> 00:30:47.875
Alright.

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:53.515
Well, then, you can follow the nurse.

00:30:54.195 --> 00:30:55.195
- Okay.
- This way, please.

00:30:57.715 --> 00:30:58.715
Please.

00:31:01.835 --> 00:31:02.675
Pat!

00:31:04.355 --> 00:31:05.635
You need to stay by her side.

00:31:45.715 --> 00:31:46.715
No use in hiding.

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:48.675
I already saw you.

00:31:52.355 --> 00:31:54.075
Say what you have to say.

00:32:01.315 --> 00:32:04.795
I can't believe Papa is your patient.

00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:07.075
If I knew,
I would've come to his appointments.

00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:09.875
Is that all you want to say?

00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:12.635
If so, please leave.

00:32:12.675 --> 00:32:13.795
I have work to do.

00:32:16.675 --> 00:32:19.315
I'm fine just staring at your face.

00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:20.975
I promise I won't be bugging you.

00:32:23.555 --> 00:32:26.115
It's lonely out there!

00:32:27.234 --> 00:32:29.058
You can't be sitting here anyway

00:32:29.288 --> 00:32:30.915
since I have a patient.

00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:33.555
I already asked the nurse,

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.955
and she said you're free for another hour.

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:39.515
Do whatever you want,

00:32:40.595 --> 00:32:41.955
except bothering me.

00:33:19.435 --> 00:33:20.075
What?

00:33:20.475 --> 00:33:21.755
Are you blushing?

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:23.675
No...

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:25.635
it's hot in here.

00:33:26.635 --> 00:33:29.995
What happened to the A/C?

00:33:39.595 --> 00:33:40.595
Hey, you!

00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:42.675
Could you not come so close?

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:44.875
Too close?

00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:45.955
Yes.

00:33:50.875 --> 00:33:51.755
Are you scared?

00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:53.035
I'm not scared.

00:33:53.995 --> 00:33:55.235
I don't want you to be close.

00:33:58.835 --> 00:33:59.835
Something on your hair!

00:34:05.235 --> 00:34:06.355
It's my heart.

00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:09.155
Wonder how it got stuck on you.

00:34:29.928 --> 00:34:31.155
Uh, Doc...

00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:33.115
Mrs. Nonthakan is all done with her test.

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:35.755
Right, thanks.

00:34:40.435 --> 00:34:43.515
Could you call her back in?

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:44.715
Of course.

00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:52.555
She's healthy,
with a well-functioning heart.

00:34:52.755 --> 00:34:54.235
There's nothing to be concerned about.

00:34:55.195 --> 00:34:56.875
You can relax now, Miss Pat.

00:34:58.515 --> 00:34:59.875
That's a relief.

00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:01.515
So...

00:35:01.555 --> 00:35:03.035
when's the next appointment?

00:35:04.715 --> 00:35:06.955
If you have any symptoms, call to make one.

00:35:07.655 --> 00:35:09.955
But the patient's daughter
wants to see you, Doc.

00:35:13.195 --> 00:35:15.235
I'd better go now, Doctor.

00:35:15.475 --> 00:35:16.595
Come on, Pat.

00:35:16.635 --> 00:35:17.635
Go home!

00:35:18.195 --> 00:35:19.395
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:24.795
Come on!

00:35:34.235 --> 00:35:34.995
Hey!

00:35:35.815 --> 00:35:36.795
Ow, Mama!

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:37.955
That hurts!

00:35:38.235 --> 00:35:41.075
Why were you bothering the doctor?

00:35:41.475 --> 00:35:43.115
Because I like Dr. Premsinee.

00:35:43.275 --> 00:35:44.115
What?!

00:35:44.795 --> 00:35:47.115
Gosh, is this why

00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:50.835
you kept insisting I come here?

00:35:54.355 --> 00:35:58.075
I heard that she has a boyfriend

00:35:58.355 --> 00:36:00.355
she's going to marry, hasn't she?

00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:01.875
She's not getting married, Mama.

00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:04.755
I was the one ruining her wedding.

00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:05.995
Huh?!

00:36:06.515 --> 00:36:10.995
I never taught you to be such an evil, Pat!

00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:15.675
Tell me everything now!

00:36:17.795 --> 00:36:19.675
I've spent so many years,

00:36:19.835 --> 00:36:22.235
thinking I could win her over,

00:36:22.475 --> 00:36:24.035
but it didn't turn out that way at all.

00:36:24.075 --> 00:36:25.915
She was just using me.

00:36:26.875 --> 00:36:30.755
Are you sure you can move on from Nam?

00:36:30.915 --> 00:36:32.635
Right now, it's still a process,

00:36:33.495 --> 00:36:36.875
but I wanna start fresh with someone new.

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.675
But Dr. Prem doesn't like women.

00:36:42.115 --> 00:36:44.275
I'm not planning to change her, Mama.

00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:46.155
But haven't you heard?

00:36:46.315 --> 00:36:49.955
There's always a chance
women might fall in love with each other,

00:36:50.435 --> 00:36:51.795
and I'm confident

00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:54.595
that I can make my way
into Dr. Prem's heart.

00:36:56.635 --> 00:36:57.555
There!

00:36:57.595 --> 00:36:59.235
What are you girls chatting about?

00:36:59.275 --> 00:37:00.395
Papa!

00:37:01.275 --> 00:37:02.395
I miss you!

00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:10.275
What are you laughing at?

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.035
I'm being serious.

00:37:12.195 --> 00:37:14.275
I'm really into your cardiologist.

00:37:16.275 --> 00:37:18.556
You'd better prepare some tissues

00:37:18.596 --> 00:37:19.796
'cause your heart's getting broken.

00:37:20.115 --> 00:37:21.755
Papa!

00:37:23.035 --> 00:37:24.875
Just so you know,

00:37:24.915 --> 00:37:26.475
I can't help you with this.

00:37:27.035 --> 00:37:29.475
Whatever you want to do,

00:37:29.675 --> 00:37:31.555
you gotta get it on your own.

00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:34.515
My daughter needs to be tough.

00:37:34.915 --> 00:37:37.315
Don't shed tears
no matter how bad it hurts, alright?

00:37:37.715 --> 00:37:39.675
If she really doesn't like you,

00:37:40.195 --> 00:37:41.795
come cry it out at home.

00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:42.955
Right, hon?

00:37:42.995 --> 00:37:43.635
Mm.

00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:46.955
You won't help me

00:37:47.255 --> 00:37:49.315
or even root for me?

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:53.875
Look, don't be so nasty to her,

00:37:53.915 --> 00:37:54.755
alright?

00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:57.355
I'm not that kind of person!

00:37:57.395 --> 00:37:58.395
Is that so?

00:37:59.555 --> 00:38:03.355
Hey, you think I don't know
what my own daughter is like?

00:38:05.315 --> 00:38:07.075
Can you promise me one thing?

00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:08.795
What promise?

00:38:10.075 --> 00:38:11.075
If one day

00:38:12.055 --> 00:38:14.195
you can't handle the heartbreak,

00:38:14.515 --> 00:38:17.235
can you go study abroad for me?

00:38:21.315 --> 00:38:22.315
Alright.

00:38:23.095 --> 00:38:25.275
Whenever the heartbreak feels unbearable,

00:38:26.315 --> 00:38:27.635
I'm not gonna push through it.

00:38:40.335 --> 00:38:41.335
Prem!

00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:42.955
Thawat!

00:38:47.275 --> 00:38:48.475
Prem...

00:38:49.675 --> 00:38:51.995
- I...
- You'd better keep quiet.

00:38:52.395 --> 00:38:53.395
I'm tired,

00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:55.175
and I need a break.

00:38:56.515 --> 00:38:58.675
I just want to talk to you!

00:38:59.995 --> 00:39:01.915
Can't you just give me a chance?

00:39:03.555 --> 00:39:04.555
Thawat,

00:39:05.535 --> 00:39:06.715
you and I

00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:08.675
are done.

00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:09.675
No, Sweet Prem.

00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:11.875
I won't let it end like this.

00:39:12.075 --> 00:39:13.155
That's enough.

00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:14.915
There's nothing you can do

00:39:15.275 --> 00:39:17.275
that will make it better.

00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:22.155
Why won't you give me a chance?

00:39:22.195 --> 00:39:24.195
And why do I have to?

00:39:24.235 --> 00:39:25.755
What you did

00:39:25.795 --> 00:39:27.955
was not something I can just forgive.

00:39:30.075 --> 00:39:31.435
Don't ever show your face again.

00:39:31.715 --> 00:39:32.715
Wait, Prem!

00:39:32.955 --> 00:39:33.915
Prem!

00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.075
- Ow!
- Prem!

00:39:35.395 --> 00:39:36.795
Listen to me, Sweet Prem.

00:39:37.395 --> 00:39:38.835
I love you.

00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:40.075
- I really do.
- Let go!

00:39:41.355 --> 00:39:43.115
I can't breathe without you.

00:39:45.315 --> 00:39:46.235
Let go!

00:39:46.275 --> 00:39:48.115
This is not what you do
to someone you love!

00:39:48.635 --> 00:39:49.395
Let go!

00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:51.075
Hey!

00:40:00.395 --> 00:40:01.395
What the hell are you doing?!

00:40:03.595 --> 00:40:04.235
Look,

00:40:05.275 --> 00:40:07.555
my girlfriend and I need to talk.

00:40:11.615 --> 00:40:14.275
Doesn't seem like it
from the look on her face.

00:40:22.235 --> 00:40:23.675
Let's go, Doc.

00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:07.355
You're not hurt, are you, Doc?

00:41:11.155 --> 00:41:12.155
No.

00:41:13.555 --> 00:41:14.635
That's a relief.

00:41:21.395 --> 00:41:22.995
Thank you for your help,

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:27.075
but please drive me back to the hospital.

00:41:27.435 --> 00:41:29.835
He might still be there if we do now.

00:41:32.435 --> 00:41:33.795
And where are you taking me?

00:41:33.835 --> 00:41:34.955
I'm hungry.

00:41:36.075 --> 00:41:37.755
Let's have dinner.

00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:09.096
Oh, Pat!

00:42:09.336 --> 00:42:11.056
Why didn't you say you were coming?

00:42:11.356 --> 00:42:13.096
It's a sudden craving.

00:42:13.296 --> 00:42:15.096
- The usual table?
- Please.

00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:16.736
Alright, just hang on a bit.

00:42:22.116 --> 00:42:23.776
Sit, Doc.

00:42:26.336 --> 00:42:28.496
Or do you not care for street dining?

00:42:34.776 --> 00:42:35.776
I do.

00:42:36.076 --> 00:42:37.496
I saw you freeze,

00:42:37.536 --> 00:42:39.350
so I thought you'd get rashes from it.

00:42:39.856 --> 00:42:41.496
If that's the case,

00:42:41.896 --> 00:42:43.176
then the noodle soup is poisonous.

00:42:44.416 --> 00:42:46.096
I guarantee there's none of that.

00:42:46.496 --> 00:42:47.776
This stall is the real one.

00:42:49.256 --> 00:42:50.856
Alright, what can I get you today?

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:54.256
Two tom yum noodles, as usual, please.

00:42:54.456 --> 00:42:55.696
What would you like?

00:42:56.896 --> 00:42:58.376
One bowl of noodle soup, no chili.

00:42:58.716 --> 00:42:59.536
Hang tight!

00:43:04.816 --> 00:43:07.496
- Can we have some water, too?
- On it!

00:43:13.336 --> 00:43:14.896
Is everything okay, Doc?

00:43:15.616 --> 00:43:17.136
You keep staring at me.

00:43:19.136 --> 00:43:20.736
I'm just trying to figure out

00:43:21.016 --> 00:43:22.496
what kind of person you are.

00:43:22.816 --> 00:43:24.856
Someone you never thought I'd be.

00:43:25.096 --> 00:43:26.256
I can agree with that

00:43:26.496 --> 00:43:28.136
since I've never thought anything of you.

00:43:30.256 --> 00:43:32.176
But I think of you all the time.

00:43:37.416 --> 00:43:40.456
Here come your noodles!

00:43:43.176 --> 00:43:44.256
There.

00:43:44.296 --> 00:43:46.956
Two tom yum noodles
and one with clear soup.

00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:48.136
Thank you!

00:43:59.576 --> 00:44:01.976
Here's your water.

00:44:02.016 --> 00:44:03.016
Thank you.

00:44:07.876 --> 00:44:08.905
Is there no spoon?

00:44:09.616 --> 00:44:10.776
Relax.

00:44:11.656 --> 00:44:12.526
Here you go.

00:44:13.096 --> 00:44:14.096
Thanks.

00:44:15.576 --> 00:44:16.576
Eat up.

00:44:17.656 --> 00:44:18.336
Alright.

00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:51.936
Is it yummy?

00:44:53.536 --> 00:44:54.536
It is.

00:44:58.276 --> 00:44:59.816
This meal is on me.

00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:01.296
Don't bother.

00:45:01.776 --> 00:45:03.696
I don't like owing anything to anyone.

00:45:04.136 --> 00:45:05.256
Who knows?

00:45:07.176 --> 00:45:09.496
I'm probably not just anyone to you.

00:45:11.516 --> 00:45:12.336
Look,

00:45:12.516 --> 00:45:13.896
I'll ask you one question:

00:45:14.636 --> 00:45:16.136
what's your plan

00:45:16.176 --> 00:45:17.976
following me like a ghost?

00:45:18.336 --> 00:45:20.336
If you think I'll go back to Thawat,

00:45:20.616 --> 00:45:21.896
then you can relax.

00:45:22.256 --> 00:45:25.216
I would never steal someone's partner
or the father of their child.

00:45:25.576 --> 00:45:27.096
And how could I be sure

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:29.416
that you won't run back to him?

00:45:29.696 --> 00:45:31.696
My moral judgment is sound.

00:45:32.136 --> 00:45:33.136
To make sure,

00:45:33.536 --> 00:45:35.896
I'll keep an eye on
every single step you take.

00:45:36.176 --> 00:45:39.696
You'd better keep an eye on
your pregnant friend.

00:45:41.816 --> 00:45:44.096
Your former groom

00:45:44.856 --> 00:45:46.256
is doing all the work.

00:45:47.376 --> 00:45:48.456
If they love each other,

00:45:48.496 --> 00:45:50.376
we shouldn't pry into it, should we?

00:45:51.136 --> 00:45:52.296
Excuse me,

00:45:53.096 --> 00:45:55.216
but if that's the only reason for all this,

00:45:55.416 --> 00:45:56.296
just stop.

00:45:56.776 --> 00:45:59.256
There is no way on earth
I'm taking Thawat from your friend.

00:45:59.616 --> 00:46:01.336
Are you pissed?

00:46:03.136 --> 00:46:04.976
Or is it that you still miss him?

00:46:05.336 --> 00:46:07.176
Who I do or don't miss

00:46:07.696 --> 00:46:08.856
is none of your business.

00:46:09.916 --> 00:46:11.536
If you won't stop insulting me,

00:46:12.456 --> 00:46:14.056
then there's nothing more to discuss.

00:46:18.536 --> 00:46:19.536
Doc!

00:46:34.896 --> 00:46:36.296
And how could I be sure

00:46:37.236 --> 00:46:39.456
that you won't run back to him?

00:46:39.976 --> 00:46:40.976
To make sure,

00:46:41.616 --> 00:46:44.016
I'll keep an eye on
every single step you take.

00:46:44.436 --> 00:46:46.216
Are you pissed?

00:46:46.516 --> 00:46:48.296
Or is it that you still miss him?

00:46:49.216 --> 00:46:50.376
What the hell are you doing?!

00:46:57.136 --> 00:46:59.136
I was hoping you'd be
better than I thought.

00:47:01.776 --> 00:47:02.656
Enough.

00:47:03.936 --> 00:47:05.056
Stop thinking.

00:47:10.056 --> 00:47:12.336
Why would you say that to the doctor?

00:47:12.376 --> 00:47:14.896
Make sure she doesn't go back to her ex?

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:17.576
So that I have a reason to approach her.

00:47:17.616 --> 00:47:19.336
Gosh, Pat!

00:47:20.056 --> 00:47:20.856
What?

00:47:22.216 --> 00:47:23.736
The more you say that,

00:47:23.776 --> 00:47:25.656
the more she's gonna hate you.

00:47:26.096 --> 00:47:27.096
Good.

00:47:27.876 --> 00:47:29.276
People get what they hate,

00:47:30.316 --> 00:47:32.376
and she's definitely gonna get me.

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:33.776
Wake up.

00:47:34.056 --> 00:47:36.416
Things like that only exist in soap operas.

00:47:36.976 --> 00:47:39.496
If you want to win her over,

00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:41.736
start by fixing your messed-up mindset.

00:47:42.816 --> 00:47:44.096
Tell me what I have to do.

00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:08.896
[Nam]

00:48:11.536 --> 00:48:12.736
Hello, Nam.

00:48:15.616 --> 00:48:17.056
You're outside my place?

00:48:21.376 --> 00:48:23.216
What brings you here so early?

00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:24.736
Why?

00:48:24.776 --> 00:48:26.416
Can't I come visit you now?

00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:28.056
No,

00:48:29.376 --> 00:48:30.536
I just wish I could sleep in.

00:48:32.336 --> 00:48:33.936
I accepted some gigs for you.

00:48:33.976 --> 00:48:36.696
Tomorrow, you'll go
to a grand opening of a beauty clinic,

00:48:36.736 --> 00:48:39.896
then a photo shoot, and
a supplementary food ad for the next day.

00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:42.509
I'm not going.

00:48:43.336 --> 00:48:44.336
I'm not doing it.

00:48:44.496 --> 00:48:45.696
I want to take a break.

00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:47.616
But you can't take a long one!

00:48:48.616 --> 00:48:50.216
Why can't I?

00:48:50.696 --> 00:48:51.336
Well...

00:48:51.736 --> 00:48:53.656
your fans are gonna be dying to see you.

00:48:53.916 --> 00:48:56.856
And if you take too long,
people are gonna forget your face.

00:48:57.096 --> 00:48:59.416
I'm thinking about studying abroad.

00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.976
You can't do that!

00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:03.896
How will I live if you go there?

00:49:04.216 --> 00:49:05.576
Are you leaving me?

00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:07.576
You have someone taking care of you now.

00:49:07.776 --> 00:49:09.616
What more do you want from me?

00:49:10.076 --> 00:49:11.076
No way.

00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:13.296
No one treats me like you do.

00:49:14.336 --> 00:49:16.056
Please don't leave me, Pat.

00:49:21.096 --> 00:49:22.096
I'm sick of this.

00:49:22.656 --> 00:49:23.656
What about me?

00:49:23.976 --> 00:49:25.776
I'm your manager;

00:49:26.076 --> 00:49:28.256
how am I supposed to live without you?

00:49:28.296 --> 00:49:29.496
Weren't you the one

00:49:29.796 --> 00:49:31.856
asking to be my manager?

00:49:33.296 --> 00:49:36.176
You knew I never wanted
to spend my whole life in the industry.

00:49:36.696 --> 00:49:37.936
But I even quit my job

00:49:37.976 --> 00:49:39.616
to be your manager, Pat!

00:49:39.656 --> 00:49:41.696
I don't recall ever asking you to.

00:49:43.056 --> 00:49:43.736
Pat,

00:49:45.016 --> 00:49:46.616
please don't go anywhere.

00:49:48.656 --> 00:49:51.736
Didn't you promise
you'd always be by my side?

00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:54.056
That was before any of this happened.

00:49:57.296 --> 00:49:58.936
You now have a partner

00:49:59.156 --> 00:50:00.296
and a baby.

00:50:00.576 --> 00:50:03.176
You need to be there
for each other now, got it?

00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:05.336
No...

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.796
You're the only one I want, Pat.

00:50:09.956 --> 00:50:11.916
Please don't leave me.

00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:14.536
Please, Pat...

00:50:15.476 --> 00:50:17.256
Don't leave me.

00:50:20.276 --> 00:50:21.636
Please don't leave me...

00:50:23.396 --> 00:50:24.636
I'm begging you...

00:50:34.296 --> 00:50:35.576
Something's wrong with Nam.

00:50:36.256 --> 00:50:37.536
She's probably hormonal

00:50:37.836 --> 00:50:39.896
or just recently traumatized.

00:50:40.156 --> 00:50:41.876
She'll attach to you like a leech for a while

00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:43.336
since she doesn't want to be dumped again.

00:50:44.436 --> 00:50:46.016
Am I too cruel?

00:50:47.456 --> 00:50:49.776
I still care about her,

00:50:50.876 --> 00:50:52.556
but I don't wanna go back
to where I was again.

00:50:53.556 --> 00:50:54.736
That's not a surprise,

00:50:55.196 --> 00:50:56.976
given how she treated you like crap.

00:50:58.676 --> 00:50:59.676
Plus,

00:50:59.716 --> 00:51:01.436
people need to move on.

00:51:03.576 --> 00:51:05.936
Yeah, they do.

00:51:08.276 --> 00:51:10.216
I really want to start fresh.

00:51:11.116 --> 00:51:12.296
What should I do?

00:51:13.456 --> 00:51:14.216
Hm...

00:51:23.876 --> 00:51:24.876
I have an idea!

00:51:27.676 --> 00:51:28.756
Hello, Big Bro.

00:51:29.196 --> 00:51:31.196
Your condo still isn't sold, is it?

00:51:32.896 --> 00:51:33.576
Great.

00:51:33.756 --> 00:51:35.009
I'll take it.

00:51:35.049 --> 00:51:37.016
Just give me some time
to sell my old place,

00:51:37.356 --> 00:51:38.656
and I'll transfer the money to you.

00:51:39.236 --> 00:51:41.696
It's settled, then, big brother.

00:51:57.576 --> 00:51:58.656
I have so many cases today.

00:51:59.256 --> 00:52:00.056
Yeah?

00:52:00.096 --> 00:52:02.136
This is the doctor
who got her wedding ruined

00:52:02.176 --> 00:52:04.376
because her groom
knocked someone else up!

00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:05.666
- Really?
- Mm!

00:52:07.416 --> 00:52:08.816
Next time, say it to our faces.

00:52:09.096 --> 00:52:09.976
Why keep it behind our backs?

00:52:10.016 --> 00:52:11.296
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

00:52:16.296 --> 00:52:17.696
Forget them, Bow.

00:52:18.136 --> 00:52:19.136
Let them be.

00:52:19.496 --> 00:52:21.136
All these people do is rub it in.

00:52:21.896 --> 00:52:23.096
It's infuriating.

00:52:23.136 --> 00:52:24.656
It's been days now,

00:52:24.856 --> 00:52:26.336
yet people still bring it up.

00:52:28.616 --> 00:52:29.609
That's how it is.

00:52:30.296 --> 00:52:31.936
Humans are social animals.

00:52:33.056 --> 00:52:34.696
When it comes to other people's business,

00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:35.976
they can't help sticking their noses in.

00:52:38.416 --> 00:52:40.216
- Let's just go.
- Mm.

00:53:18.117 --> 00:53:19.117
Hello?

00:53:19.397 --> 00:53:20.597
Alright, I'm coming.

00:53:21.397 --> 00:53:22.397
Prem, I have an urgent case.

00:53:22.877 --> 00:53:23.757
Gotta go.

00:53:24.077 --> 00:53:25.317
Put away the tray for me.

00:53:25.917 --> 00:53:26.797
Mm.

00:53:40.677 --> 00:53:42.517
Where are you rushing off to, Doc?

00:53:42.917 --> 00:53:44.677
I wanna consult with you about Mama.

00:53:44.877 --> 00:53:47.077
I'm here as a patient's relative.

00:53:53.037 --> 00:53:54.557
Say what you have to.

00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:57.477
Here's what happened.

00:53:57.637 --> 00:54:00.277
The other day, after Mama got home,

00:54:00.317 --> 00:54:02.357
she got really tired again.

00:54:02.576 --> 00:54:03.757
Tired how?

00:54:04.277 --> 00:54:05.877
Did she get tired from just sitting

00:54:06.157 --> 00:54:07.517
or after doing something?

00:54:09.557 --> 00:54:11.037
Just from sitting.

00:54:11.177 --> 00:54:13.957
I guess I need to bring her in again.

00:54:14.477 --> 00:54:15.997
I'm worried sick about her, you know?

00:54:16.317 --> 00:54:17.397
Is it okay...

00:54:17.837 --> 00:54:20.517
if I just go ahead
and make an appointment with you?

00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:23.597
Look, Miss Pat,

00:54:24.254 --> 00:54:25.997
stop using your mother as an excuse.

00:54:26.277 --> 00:54:27.356
To be honest,

00:54:27.396 --> 00:54:28.877
I don't buy anything
coming out of your mouth.

00:54:29.357 --> 00:54:31.237
I'm not using my mom as an excuse!

00:54:31.277 --> 00:54:32.357
I'm being serious!

00:54:36.277 --> 00:54:37.377
Doc!

00:54:37.417 --> 00:54:38.757
Wait for me!

00:54:43.297 --> 00:54:44.717
Slow down, Doc.

00:54:46.017 --> 00:54:47.397
Don't get mad at me.

00:54:47.857 --> 00:54:50.437
I'll admit that I used Mama as an excuse,

00:54:50.477 --> 00:54:52.157
but that was only because I wanna see you

00:54:52.497 --> 00:54:53.917
and talk to you.

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:55.757
What do you expect me to do?

00:54:57.137 --> 00:55:00.437
I don't have time
to mess around with you, Miss Pat.

00:55:01.177 --> 00:55:02.557
I have work to do.

00:55:03.137 --> 00:55:04.757
If you have that much time to spare,

00:55:05.297 --> 00:55:06.397
find someone else to play with.

00:55:08.377 --> 00:55:09.637
I'm not playing around.

00:55:09.857 --> 00:55:10.997
I'm serious.

00:55:11.377 --> 00:55:12.677
Please excuse me,

00:55:13.297 --> 00:55:14.297
and don't you follow me.

00:56:18.597 --> 00:56:19.917
Not so hard to say, is it?

00:56:25.237 --> 00:56:26.477
What's wrong with my car?!

00:56:40.357 --> 00:56:41.477
Hey, Papa.

00:56:42.117 --> 00:56:43.877
I'm at the hospital you usually come to.

00:56:44.457 --> 00:56:46.757
Can you send someone over for my car?

00:56:49.197 --> 00:56:50.517
It broke down.

00:56:59.877 --> 00:57:01.477
I don't even know what happened to it.

00:57:02.037 --> 00:57:03.237
I'm waiting.

00:57:42.777 --> 00:57:43.597
Your car broke down?

00:57:43.637 --> 00:57:44.597
Yes,

00:57:44.917 --> 00:57:46.877
I'm waiting for someone
to come and take care of it.

00:57:48.877 --> 00:57:50.997
Judging from how nice you're right now...

00:57:52.477 --> 00:57:54.157
Does that mean you like my gift?

00:57:56.717 --> 00:57:58.397
I'm just simply checking in

00:57:59.157 --> 00:58:00.477
to see if I can help.

00:58:02.137 --> 00:58:03.397
You're so kind.

00:58:04.577 --> 00:58:05.917
I'm not kind,

00:58:05.957 --> 00:58:09.757
but since you saved me
from that man last time,

00:58:10.137 --> 00:58:11.697
I thought I should return the favor,

00:58:12.317 --> 00:58:14.037
so we can be even.

00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:18.597
You can believe

00:58:18.637 --> 00:58:20.317
whatever you'd like to believe,

00:58:22.097 --> 00:58:24.357
but I'll take it as you care about me.

00:58:42.977 --> 00:58:43.977
Well,

00:58:44.737 --> 00:58:45.877
how are you gonna go home?

00:58:46.537 --> 00:58:48.117
Maybe looking for an Uber.

00:58:49.457 --> 00:58:50.357
No need.

00:58:50.757 --> 00:58:51.817
I'll give you a ride.

00:58:54.177 --> 00:58:55.637
Are you really?!

00:58:56.617 --> 00:58:58.157
I'm having a second thought now.

00:59:00.297 --> 00:59:02.117
Doc, please give me a ride home!

00:59:02.657 --> 00:59:03.797
Thanks!

00:59:28.957 --> 00:59:30.317
Thank you.

00:59:30.777 --> 00:59:31.777
Are you ready?

00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:33.617
Let's go!

00:59:57.857 --> 00:59:59.517
Just make a left up ahead.

01:00:16.217 --> 01:00:17.417
You live here?

01:00:17.457 --> 01:00:18.477
I do.

01:00:19.057 --> 01:00:20.557
Is there something wrong?

01:00:23.657 --> 01:00:25.317
I also live here.

01:00:29.997 --> 01:00:31.677
I just moved in earlier today.

01:00:31.717 --> 01:00:34.637
I'm so happy we live in the same complex!

01:00:47.417 --> 01:00:49.237
Your place is on the 26th floor?

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:50.437
It is.

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:51.997
Why do you ask?

01:00:52.117 --> 01:00:53.397
We're on the same floor.

01:00:55.317 --> 01:00:56.237
We are?

01:01:09.517 --> 01:01:10.397
Miss Pat!

01:01:11.677 --> 01:01:13.037
Are you hurt?

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.637
Is this another one of your tricks?

01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:53.317
It's okay.

01:01:55.157 --> 01:01:56.477
It's gonna be fine.

01:01:57.877 --> 01:01:59.677
Breathe slowly.

01:02:00.157 --> 01:02:01.157
Breathe.

01:02:56.677 --> 01:02:57.637
Doc...

01:02:58.477 --> 01:02:59.197
Yes?

01:03:01.197 --> 01:03:03.437
From this moment on,

01:03:04.477 --> 01:03:06.277
I'm gonna win you over.

01:03:13.797 --> 01:03:18.477
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.943
â«Only I can make you mineâ«

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:26.470
â«Would you let yourself fall for me?â«

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:29.697
â«Only I can make you mineâ«
