Wanyan.

- Wanyan!
- Wanyan!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.680
Bai Xiaoying, you...

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.680
Wanyan,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.780
do you remember
how you beat me back then?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.819
How does

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.439
it feel?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.219
Bai Xiaoying,

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.319
what I regret least

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.419
was beating you, a wretch.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.879
- Wanyan!
- Wanyan!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.800
In your world,

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.919
you can do whatever you want.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.960
Then in mine,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.000
you'll taste what it's like

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
to be trampled beneath someone's feet.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.560
Bai Xiaoying,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.800
you're just a madwoman!

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.439
Even at my maddest,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.919
I couldn't match a ten-thousandth
of your father's madness.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:57.580
Your beloved father

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.860
disgraced his immortal lord title.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.860
He's more despicable

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.659
than even that Night Deity!

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.439
- Wanyan!
- Wanyan!

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.259
Bai Xiaoying.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.099
You're insane!

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.060
I remember you.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.259
Among those who beat me,

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:22.840
you had a part too, didn't you?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.539
So today, why don't you

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.539
experience it yourself too?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.259
Master!

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.539
Master, help!

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.020
Master!

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.099
Master, help!

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.699
- Senior! Senior!
- Senior.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.099
Wanyan!

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500
You two

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.500
have committed your share of evils.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.979
I'll leave them for you to handle.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.939
Master!

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.180
Master, we are your disciples!

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.860
Master!

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.419
Master, spare us!

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.460
We've remained in the Nine Heavens.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.099
We never went to Snowfall Valley!

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.460
Master, have mercy!

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.580
Don't do this, Master!

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.899
Spare us!

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:23.699
You won't show mercy now, will you?

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:26.819
Don't forget

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.779
when the Immortal Lord tortured you,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.459
none of them

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.500
pleaded for mercy on your behalf.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.740
That's not true, Master.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.980
That's not true!

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.639
- Stop!
- Yunya!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.420
You're a dignified immortal lord.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.100
Yet you willingly
became the Night Clan's lapdog,

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.839
even harming your own sect members.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.019
You disgrace the immortal sects!

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.579
Who are you to speak?

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.420
Did you also participate

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.459
in the massacre of Snowfall Valley?

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.980
Enough.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.819
What?

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.699
Do even you think I'm wrong?

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.180
Of course not.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.699
Whatever you do,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.980
I'll support you.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.860
But if this continues,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.899
they might all die.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.899
Let's keep them alive

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.699
to torture them later.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.180
It'd be more amusing.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.699
Don't you agree?

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:46.620
Well said.

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:48.660
Guards!

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.779
- Yes?
- Yes?

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.540
Take them to the prison.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.740
Guard them closely.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.540
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.180
Senior?

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.060
Senior?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.699
Senior.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.100
I heard those
who joined Snowfall Valley earlier

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.980
were all slaughtered.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.519
Bai Xiaoying imprisoned us here.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.740
Does she plan to avenge them

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.860
by killing us all?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.060
She's the Night Deity now.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.740
Even without revenge as a motive,

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:14.939
when she decides to kill,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.060
she needs no reason.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.660
I wonder where the Immortal Lord hides.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.439
But

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.060
he'll surely return to save us.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:24.819
Today he didn't even
save his own daughter.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.899
Don't expect him to save us.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.839
That's not true.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.199
Maybe something urgent came up.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.899
Yunya.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.259
Immortal Lord.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:48.420
Traitor.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.060
Are you here to kill me
for Bai Xiaoying?

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.139
You left the Stabilizing Pills
in my room.

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.819
I'm returning them.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:05.300
A stable foundation

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.459
will make your injuries heal faster.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.060
Yunya,

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.079
about what happened today,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.720
don't you have anything to say?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.100
What should I say?

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.579
Will you keep indulging Bai Xiaoying

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.740
to be so cruel

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.040
and watching us being tortured to death
without intervention?

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.100
What you did to her back then

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.860
was far worse than her actions today.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.100
She almost died several times
because of you.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.680
How can you call her cruel now?

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:58.079
Yunya, how could you say that about me?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.620
That day I risked my father's punishment

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.019
to inform Bai Xiaoying to save you.

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:10.259
Am I really so disposable in your eyes?

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:14.459
Even if I bullied Bai Xiaoying before,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.980
didn't you always protect her

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.459
and always oppose me?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.579
Why do you react differently
when everything is reversed now?

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.300
She's tormenting me like this,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.100
yet you aid her tyranny

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.180
and turn a blind eye?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.779
If I truly turned a blind eye,

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:31.779
I wouldn't have come.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.299
Enough!

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.039
Stop crying, Wanyan.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:44.139
Stop crying.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.500
You came.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:20.419
I couldn't find you.

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:21.460
I knew you'd be here.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:23.220
I came only

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:24.940
to see you.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.600
This place remains the same

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:29.919
as it was before.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:34.860
Yes.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:38.700
But the immortal sects
aren't the same anymore.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.620
You visited the prison?

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.659
I just went to teach them a lesson

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.940
to tell them

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.220
that your actions now

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.220
are retribution for what they did

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:53.059
and that they should reflect

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.419
and stop opposing you.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.000
Yunya,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.039
you've turned to me publicly.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:04.299
It was a betrayal to the immortal sects.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.639
Yet now you pity them?

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:08.980
What do you truly want?

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:13.419
I want to do

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.980
what I believe is right.

00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:18.460
What's right?

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:21.740
Balancing factions

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.220
and weighing options?

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.659
Or being loyal to the Immortal Lord,

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:29.019
yet can't bear seeing me suffer
in the Nine Heavens?

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100
Or perhaps

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.320
having chosen me,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.100
you now think
I shouldn't be this ruthless?

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.220
So tell me,

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.259
what right thing

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.019
will you do next?

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:51.059
I want the Xiaoying
from Snowfall Valley back.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.539
Let's turn here

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.139
into Snowfall Valley together.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.700
Don't mention that place!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.820
This world doesn't need Snowfall Valley

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.580
or deserve Snowfall Valley.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.980
Yunya, listen to me.

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:06.580
Face reality.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.620
The person before you now
is the Night Deity.

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:11.460
Between me and them,

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:13.659
you must choose one.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.940
I knew it.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.460
You can't make the choice.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.419
You always play the peacemaker,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.899
leaving room for both sides.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:37.820
You once saved me,

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:40.179
so I won't harm you.

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:42.980
Leave

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:44.740
and don't come back.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:53.139
I told you

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:54.899
no matter what happens,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.580
I'll always stand by you.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.539
Actually, I don't enjoy killing.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.259
Nor do I take pleasure in torture.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.860
But I've just
conquered the Nine Heavens.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.500
Many across the Three Realms
still resist me.

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:17.899
Moreover,

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:20.620
we haven't captured Feng Changgeng yet.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.980
If I don't assert authority,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.460
those people will think
they can trample on me.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.220
I understand.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.139
Whatever you need me for,

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.580
I'll do it for you.

00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:35.379
I need

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.899
the Three Realms to know

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:40.340
who truly holds their fates

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:43.379
and who their real master is.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.340
Okay.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.179
This delicate Nine Heavens lady's skin
is too tender.

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:04.019
We dare not beat her.

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:06.360
She'd break too easily.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:09.820
Lord has decreed

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.340
this task falls to you.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.500
Now that everyone's present.

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:46.620
Let's begin.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.580
Immortal Yunya,

00:13:58.179 --> 00:13:59.340
if you don't do it,

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.259
I'll do it for you.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.500
Yunya!

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:43.659
Bai Xiaoying has gone mad.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.139
Do you truly intend to aid a tyrant?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.460
(I'm doing this)

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.379
(to protect all your lives.)

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.299
Enough for today.

00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:15.899
Don't damage them completely.

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:17.940
We'll savor their torment slowly.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.700
Tie them by the Golden Light Gate

00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:29.460
and guard them closely.

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:31.936
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.679
My lord.

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:30.179
Truly remarkable.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.580
Even with just one soul and one spirit,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.019
you can perform like a puppet.

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:39.500
It seems I

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.340
will meet him soon enough.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:51.879
I failed.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:53.860
No traces of the Immortal Lord
were found.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.500
Useless!

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.019
The Night Clan's Right Envoy

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.860
can't handle such a simple task?

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:05.539
Please calm down.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.380
Grant me more time.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.859
I will retrieve the Immortal Lord.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.500
If everyone offered such excuses,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.859
how could I rule the Three Realms?

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:18.819
Xiaoying,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.059
I've completed what you requested.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.819
The Night Deity's name

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.859
and Feng Changgeng's flight
from Heaven's Gate

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:25.740
echo through realms.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.380
His pride stings most.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.579
He'll make his move.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.779
I've bound Wanyan and the others

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.059
outside Golden Light Gate.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.900
They may lure him out.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.299
None but Immortal Yunya
shares my burdens.

00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:39.299
Report!

00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:43.900
Immortal Lord is near Golden Light Gate.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.559
He's likely here for his daughter.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.700
I see.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.180
Keep vigilant watch.

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:53.140
Dismissed.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.120
Understood.

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:00.660
Yunya has drawn out
Feng Changgeng for me.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.259
He merits reward.

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:06.859
Hear me, Night Clan!

00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:07.859
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:09.619
Henceforth,

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:11.599
Yunya's word is my command.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.500
His every decree

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.420
shall be your law.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.740
Disrespect towards him

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.299
is treason against me.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.700
Understood?

00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:23.460
- Understood!
- Understood!

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:29.740
Yunya,

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:32.859
having newly claimed the Nine Heavens,

00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:35.180
I need capable allies.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.740
Stay by my side.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.140
Anything you want.

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.279
Name it,

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.059
and I'll get it for you.

00:18:43.819 --> 00:18:45.140
In that case,

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:47.500
I'll ensure your worth is rewarded.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.359
My lord.

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:04.500
Wanyan

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.059
is tied at Golden Light Gate.

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:07.220
I think

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.880
it's a trap to lure us in.

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:10.519
They're baiting us.

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:13.819
Their defenses are impenetrable.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.059
With just five of us,

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:18.619
escaping unscathed seems impossible.

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:22.960
But abandoning her

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.460
would make us the realms' laughingstock.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.859
They come fast.

00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:40.819
Enough debate.

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:43.220
Today I'll reunite you all in death.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.500
You destroyed my Snowfall Valley.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.039
Prepare to die today!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.940
Ye Chenyuan?

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.940
Is it really you?

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:21.099
How did you come back?

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:23.980
When did you come back?

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:26.940
Why didn't you tell me?

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.619
(Kill her.)

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:36.819
(She's the Night Deity.)

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.180
(Kill the Night Deity now.)

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.799
(Kill her!)

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:47.019
Xiaoying!

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.420
Xiaoying!

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.500
Yuan?

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:04.819
Why?

00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:10.339
Don't you recognize me anymore?

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.660
Feng Changgeng,

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.140
this is your doing!

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:24.740
What did you do to him?

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.480
Nothing much.

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:29.380
I revived him.

00:21:30.099 --> 00:21:32.859
I never imagined
you cared so deeply for him.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:35.619
Pity he only retains
one soul and one spirit now.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.140
He has no memories

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.220
or consciousness.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.119
He only obeys my commands.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.420
Tell me.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.059
How can he be fully revived?

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:51.900
You want to completely revive him?

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.579
There is a way.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.700
Accelerate his reincarnation cycle

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.500
and restore
his other two souls and six spirits.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.259
If you submit to my authority,

00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:06.180
this becomes easily achievable.

00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.099
Otherwise,

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:10.980
I can have him perish anytime.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.339
Don't believe him.

00:22:15.099 --> 00:22:16.119
He just wants to use him,

00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:17.940
whether human or ghost, to control you.

00:22:18.688 --> 00:22:21.248
Immortal sects indeed manage
reincarnation across Three Realms.

00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:23.059
But it needn't be him.

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:30.660
Yuan,

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.259
what's wrong?

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:33.140
Yuan?

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.900
Where's the pain?

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:39.339
Yuan?

00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:40.779
Well?

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:42.779
Does it ache your heart?

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.700
Is it agonizing?

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.779
If you obey me from now on,

00:22:48.019 --> 00:22:49.940
I'll stop immediately.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.220
How about it?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.380
If I hear correctly,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.039
you're threatening me?

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.619
Haven't measured your own worth?

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.440
What gives you the right

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.819
to dare bargain with me!

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.500
Release Ye Chenyuan's restraints now!

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:25.740
Or I'll kill you this instant!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.819
I

00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:39.420
agree.

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:48.180
But during his revival,

00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:51.339
you shouldn't kill my sect members.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.380
Also,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.299
I need to revive him
in the Reincarnation Gate's chamber.

00:23:58.299 --> 00:23:59.700
No disturbances allowed.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.900
Deal.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.900
Jiaotu, Hua Yuying,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.259
keep Feng Changgeng watched.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.339
Take all other sect members

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.259
to the prison.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.220
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.539
Yuan,

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.059
let's go.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.940
Let's go home.

00:24:29.856 --> 00:24:32.090
(Huiyue Abode)

00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:35.599
Do you know?

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:38.259
After you left,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.960
every time I visited places

00:24:41.248 --> 00:24:42.880
where we shared memories,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.240
my mind was filled

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.559
with your image.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.140
I opened Snowfall Valley

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:02.940
not just to shelter the displaced.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.440
I needed to stay busy

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.220
and occupied

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.099
so that

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:13.220
I could briefly forget

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:15.740
the pain of losing you.

00:25:21.299 --> 00:25:23.339
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.380
Thankfully you returned.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.579
Thankfully you came back to me.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.700
Yuan,

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.500
after all we've been through,

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:50.460
you won't easily forget me, right?

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.339
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:58.299
Yuan?

00:25:58.339 --> 00:25:59.740
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:03.619
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:06.500
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.220
Yuan!

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.180
It's me!

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.420
Why has it come to this?

00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:39.660
Ye Chenyuan!

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.660
I'm not the Night Deity
you want to kill.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.819
I'm Bai.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.140
Yuan!

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.819
I beg you.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.220
Please remember quickly.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:58.019
I beg you.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.940
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:08.619 --> 00:27:09.779
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:11.420
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.180
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:14.619
Do you hate me so much?

00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:17.980
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.672
- (Kill the Night Deity.)
- Are you so eager to kill me?

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:21.696
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:23.539
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.180
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.720
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:37.380
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.539
(Kill the Night Deity.)

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.940
Why does Ye Chenyuan remain like this?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.460
He even wants to kill me.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.579
You promised to fully revive him.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.180
Have you done anything these past days?

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.819
He only has
one soul and one spirit left.

00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:03.740
Yet he still believes himself
an immortal sect member

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:05.140
and that you're the Night Deity.

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:06.940
That's why he wants to kill you.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.759
I've exhausted all methods
to hasten his revival.

00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:13.079
You know I used Immortal Attendants'
blood for acceleration.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.660
But if we kill them all,

00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:17.579
the Reincarnation Gate
will cease functioning.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.619
That's not my concern.

00:28:25.619 --> 00:28:27.220
That's your problem to solve.

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:29.660
There is one solution.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.660
Night Deity's power.

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:35.339
Your blood

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.380
is more effective than that of

00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:38.859
100 Immortal Attendants.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.420
But if we do this,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.900
wouldn't the Night Deity's power
return to him?

00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:51.579
Then it depends on

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.619
whether you want him dead

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:55.859
or alive.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.660
It's up to you.

00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:29.579
He only has
one soul and one spirit left.

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:32.420
His memory loss is natural.

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:35.440
How can I blame him?

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:39.039
I should find ways

00:29:39.619 --> 00:29:40.859
to help him remember.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:48.339
Jiaotu.

00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:53.420
Yes, my lord?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.759
Order everyone

00:29:54.944 --> 00:29:56.128
to rebuild Snowfall Valley

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.059
with haste.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.420
