"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 4)

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.201
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:05.000
Calm down.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.911
Easy there, just get up.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.291
Just calm down.

00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:15.338
Sorry.

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:17.064
It's okay.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.201
Where is this place?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.920
Ms. Rachawadee's house.

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.160
You had a high fever last night

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.920
and passed out on the side of the road.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.500
So I took you here to rest.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.040
What did you uncle do to you last night?

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.120
He started the fight like usual.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.480
He doesn't like my family that much.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.960
He have had arguments
with my father for such a long time.

00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:02.280
But he followed you from Chansaeng to Bangkok

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.760
he must have hated you so much.

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:08.200
Your family got more problems than I thought.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.760
It's more complicated when

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.120
we got more money and higher reputation.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960
If I wasn't born as Prince Kamfah's son,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.560
my life would have been much easier.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.200
Well, if something is bothering your mind,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.000
you can talk to me from now on.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.480
Talk to you?

00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:55.750
That's right, talk to me.

00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:58.840
I know that I'm just a low-income musician,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.951
but,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.840
it's better than keeping it to yourself.

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:07.824
Thank you.

00:04:32.157 --> 00:04:33.158
Right,

00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:35.080
you guys are up.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.800
You hungry? I finished cooking breakfast.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.391
Let's eat.

00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:58.280
Thank you for letting me stay for a night.

00:04:58.503 --> 00:04:59.801
And you cooked for me.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.120
Don't mention it.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.920
Sasin spends the night here all the time.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.560
He does, huh?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.071
You surprised?

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:11.200
It's not like that.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.100
We're just friends.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.720
After work, musicians at the bar like

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.521
to hang out here and sleep over.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.000
Sasin is single.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.720
I'm wondering

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.040
who would win a heart of my hot violinist.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.100
I think

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.100
he's better off single.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.600
- I feel sorry for his future lover.
- Hey! You!

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.101
Just eat, okay?

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.991
Add this too.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.920
Stop mocking me.

00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:57.964
Thanks.

00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:01.650
- Some pepper?
- Just a little.

00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:04.840
That's enough.

00:06:11.897 --> 00:06:13.680
Is he gonna be okay?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.760
Such irresponsible young man.

00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:20.280
He's here.

00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:22.138
Grandma.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.361
Where have you been all night?

00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.500
I was worried sick about you.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.920
I didn't feel well and I couldn't make it home.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.200
- Are you feeling better? You want to see a doctor?
- That's right.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.441
Saenkaew had high fever last night. Now he's fine.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.960
I'm sorry for not calling Pin last night to tell her

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.360
that Saenkaew was with me.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.841
You spent the night with Pin's cousin?

00:07:01.357 --> 00:07:03.440
Kamsu! How did you get here?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.480
Kamsu was here since last night.

00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:10.280
Actually, he called to tell me that he'd be in Bangkok.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760
But I forgot to tell everyone.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.931
Sir?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.400
Why did you have to spend a night with a man?

00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:34.897
If your dad found out about this…

00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:36.360
There was nothing going on.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.760
I told you that I met Uncle Inthorn,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.520
and Sasin came to rescue then
he took me to his friend's house.

00:07:44.283 --> 00:07:46.484
Can you keep it down?

00:07:48.297 --> 00:07:49.520
Kamsu,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.120
what we need to worry right now is

00:07:52.443 --> 00:07:54.497
figuring out what Prince Inthorn is after,

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.480
not picking on Prince Saenkaew like this.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.440
Prince Inthorn has nothing to worry about,

00:08:00.943 --> 00:08:02.400
but this is what we should be worried about.

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:07.000
Sir? You shouldn't get closer to that guy.

00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:09.520
If you caused a scandal,

00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:12.440
- it could lead to your dad.
- Hey, you crossed the line.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.800
I know my duties.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.581
I need to protect the family's assets,

00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:22.680
and my dad's dignity.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.200
I know I'm not his perfect son,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.800
but you should respect me.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.280
I'm sorry.

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:44.840
I'm just doing my job.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:46.840
And I hope that

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.320
you should do yours as well.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.640
How dare you, Kamsu!

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.451
How could you talk to him like that?

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.931
Kamsu!

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.160
I'm just doing my job.

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:07.480
- Prince Kamfah sent me here to take care of him.
- Take care?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.800
You're trying to pick on him.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.900
You know it well that Prince Saenkaew

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.120
have behaved and been well-mannered

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.600
since forever, he has never caused any trouble.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.560
That's when he was in Chansaeng.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.480
We're in Bangkok, far away from Prince Kamfah.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.440
Prince Saenkaew could behave loosely.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.080
If someone found out about him,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.240
we all could be in big trouble.

00:09:38.023 --> 00:09:39.024
Kamsu!

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.891
Kamsu!

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.120
If we found out about Prince Saenkaew, they'd be in trouble?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.240
What is that?

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:53.458
I have no idea, but not in a positive way for sure.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:56.760
I won't let our palace to be ruined.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.081
Just being in a relationship with a homeless prince

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.320
is humiliating enough.

00:10:11.803 --> 00:10:13.760
I think having scandal

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.600
could be a good thing.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.700
We could seize their engagement offerings

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.840
and dowry, all of them.

00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:23.680
They can get married.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.280
When we receive their assets,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.960
we can tell them to go home.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.280
Homeless princes.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.001
First of all,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.920
we need to find out what Prince Saenkaew is hiding.

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:55.560
Last night, I saw him around here.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.100
I don't know whom he was supposed to meet.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.280
They're gonna meet again today?

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.041
Nope.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.551
What?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.840
Nope? Why are we here for?

00:11:07.177 --> 00:11:09.178
Well…

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.320
Just in case they'd meet again today.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.400
Come on, my baby

00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:17.200
what do you expect me to do? This is all I got.

00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:21.480
Please give me your beautiful smile.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:24.320
Let's look at the other side.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.160
Wait for me.

00:11:39.537 --> 00:11:40.760
I'm here.

00:11:41.303 --> 00:11:43.200
- I'm here.
- Sasin!

00:11:43.423 --> 00:11:46.400
- You're always late.
- Well, I'm here now.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.640
Let's get going.

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:01.418
Where're you going?

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.600
Well, Pin invited Saenkaew to watch a movie.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.360
And they're gonna hang out later.

00:12:12.903 --> 00:12:14.640
I'm forced to drive them around.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.200
You shouldn't have troubled Mr. Sasin.

00:12:21.051 --> 00:12:22.760
Let me drive you.

00:12:23.163 --> 00:12:25.320
It's not a trouble at all.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.840
We're close,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.241
right?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.281
Tell him.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.920
I should drive.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.640
Ms. Pin can tell me where to go.

00:12:40.977 --> 00:12:41.978
Sir?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.720
Why don't you tell him that I can drive you?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.080
Well, then…

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.480
if you really want to drive,

00:12:58.363 --> 00:12:59.364
here's the key.

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.120
Pin, let's sit in the back with me.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.391
Thanks.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.801
Wait, wait!

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.040
I drive them so you don't have to go.

00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:19.520
Why's that?

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.920
We've planned it.

00:13:23.597 --> 00:13:25.250
Saenkaew, get in.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.120
Drive safe, okay?

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.200
Okay.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.200
You haven't been to Banglamphu, have you?

00:13:53.451 --> 00:13:55.080
I haven't. This is my first time.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.570
That one is cute.

00:14:13.023 --> 00:14:14.880
Pin, let's see this.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.640
Pin?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.650
They sell many cool stuff, let's see.

00:14:36.723 --> 00:14:39.680
You don't have to get this close.

00:14:39.897 --> 00:14:40.898
Sir?

00:14:41.257 --> 00:14:42.320
Should we go now?

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.120
Uncle Kamsu, we just got here.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.500
I'm worried about Princess Sridara.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.840
She said that she didn't feel well this morning.

00:15:00.843 --> 00:15:03.160
That's so boring. He's following us like we're prisoners.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.081
Wait for me by the road in the back, okay?

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.360
- What're you doing?
- Come on, trust me.

00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:16.880
Are you hungry?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.500
Not really.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.080
- But there are so many good foods here.
- When I say to run,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.600
- you need to run.
- What?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.640
Prince Inthorn's here!

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.040
- Prince Inthorn?
- Run!

00:15:30.803 --> 00:15:31.480
Prince Saenkaew?

00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:41.483
Prince Saenkaew?

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.600
What the heck are you doing?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.721
Run away from a prison guard.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.680
Kamsu's gonna scold me for sure.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:58.871
Where're you going?

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:01.120
To see Kamsu, we should stop.

00:16:01.397 --> 00:16:04.160
You can't! Kamsu will kill me.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.231
No, he's gonna be mad at me.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.360
- Let's go, it's fine.
- Prince Saenkaew!

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:10.804
Go home!

00:16:15.177 --> 00:16:16.880
What're you doing?

00:16:17.957 --> 00:16:19.920
- Hurry up!
- Mr. Sasin!

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.560
You can't do that.

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:25.160
- Come on!
- Stop!

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.223
Stop!

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.681
Stop!

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.291
Stop!

00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:33.952
Why're you acting like this?

00:16:40.557 --> 00:16:41.558
Let's go.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.500
Hurry up!

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.160
Hey! You broke all my eggs, where're you going?

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:50.440
Pay for my eggs.

00:16:55.023 --> 00:16:56.024
Hey!

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.201
Hey!

00:16:57.557 --> 00:16:59.240
Stop! I can't breathe.

00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:07.404
Hey!

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.720
I'll have a fight with Kamsu later for sure,
he looks so furious.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.720
He should be, did you see that?

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.960
He's covered in eggs, such a big mess.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.571
You're right.

00:17:25.103 --> 00:17:26.104
Kamsu,

00:17:26.323 --> 00:17:27.324
you poor thing.

00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:37.518
I like that.

00:17:40.418 --> 00:17:41.419
What?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.160
I like that you laugh and smile like this.

00:17:57.081 --> 00:17:59.360
It's better than being stressed out, you know?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.321
That's right.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.560
Actually, I almost forgot

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.720
when was the last time I laughed like this.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.840
You're here.

00:18:33.643 --> 00:18:34.644
Pin?

00:18:36.977 --> 00:18:38.520
You caused troubles again.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.840
What should we do next?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.801
What do you think?

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.100
We can follow our original plan.

00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:46.958
Let's go.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.731
Follow me.

00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:51.923
Let's go.

00:18:52.003 --> 00:18:53.404
Let's go.

00:19:19.003 --> 00:19:20.004
So good.

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:22.760
I told you that this is good.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.801
You need something to drink?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.481
I'll get something for us.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.401
Wait here.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.040
I'm the happiest girl.

00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:39.324
I feel like

00:20:40.124 --> 00:20:42.440
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:46.840
I have super nice cousin

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.600
and the best fiancé.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.400
I want all three of us to stay like this forever.

00:21:04.343 --> 00:21:05.344
I'm back.

00:21:06.103 --> 00:21:07.104
Thanks.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.511
For you.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.761
Thank you.

00:21:15.037 --> 00:21:17.000
It's not that good, that one.

00:21:17.557 --> 00:21:19.120
- Why's that?
- Just kidding.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.691
Welcome home.

00:22:04.443 --> 00:22:07.797
- I need to wash my face, I'm sweating.
- Sure.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.561
You know that I need to report your dad about this, right?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.640
Go ahead.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.720
I also want to know what did I do wrong?

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.561
You can't.

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:44.800
Why would you want his dad to be mad at him?

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.360
This is nothing.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.160
You shouldn't have been
so close to Mr. Sasin in the first place.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.771
Kamsu.

00:22:56.503 --> 00:22:58.604
Why do you make such a big deal

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.681
if he wants to have a friend?

00:23:05.103 --> 00:23:08.320
- Homthip, take him to his room.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:23:13.803 --> 00:23:15.040
Follow me.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:16.971
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.541
Tell me

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.000
why can't they be friends?

00:23:37.457 --> 00:23:39.760
Prince Kamfah sent me to take care of his son.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.200
I need to stop what could be a problem

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.001
to this marriage.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.241
How could Sasin be a trouble in this marriage?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.421
He's Pin's cousin.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.200
Distant cousin.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.900
Prince Bodin and his wife didn't even call him a relative.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.320
Why're you so attached to the titles?

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.760
We don't even have our land to live.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.080
We need to stay in others' place.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.360
I'm afraid that he could be bad influence to Prince Saenkaew.

00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:14.680
You saw that

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.240
he took Prince Saenkaew to run away with him.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.160
Prince Saenkaew never behaved like this back home.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.901
- When he met Mr. Sasin…
- Kamsu

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.881
since his mom passed away,

00:24:30.481 --> 00:24:33.680
I've never seen him smile.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.760
He now has a friend, he smiles,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.300
and he laughs like he used to.

00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:45.280
Don't you want him to be happy?

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.280
I understand you.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.281
I also want him to be happy.

00:24:58.961 --> 00:25:02.720
But it could be a trouble if we let this slide.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.640
Explain to me,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.761
what could be a big damage

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.480
if they become friends?

00:25:17.437 --> 00:25:20.080
See? You can't tell me.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.801
You just have an attitude towards Sasin.

00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:26.500
If you still care about me,

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.720
don't let his dad know about this.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.441
Kamfah has a lot on his plate.

00:25:34.017 --> 00:25:37.018
He doesn't need to know about this nonsense.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.881
You're back?

00:26:02.623 --> 00:26:06.100
You're gonna lecture me about running away
from Kamsu, aren't you?

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.357
Why would I do that?

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.840
He's too strict and this is fine.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.320
We're in Bangkok,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.921
not a savage land like Chansaeng.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.922
Why did they need that much protection?

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.721
Well,

00:26:35.943 --> 00:26:39.720
what did Prince Saenkaew and Kamsu talk about?

00:26:41.703 --> 00:26:44.320
They didn't talk much.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.360
But I feel like

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.360
Kamsu doesn't really like Sasin.

00:26:52.157 --> 00:26:55.480
I guess it's because Sasin likes to tease people.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.040
Duangkamol?

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.200
You can't take a nap here.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.200
Help me look if Saenkaew comes here to see his woman.

00:27:19.243 --> 00:27:21.440
Oh, come on!

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.920
We watched him all day yesterday and we got nothing.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.601
What do you want me to do?

00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:31.682
I'm tired too.

00:27:57.683 --> 00:28:00.640
- Duangkamol!
- What?

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.360
That woman.

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:06.080
- Which one?
- The one standing in front of a pawn shop.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.560
It's her.

00:28:10.983 --> 00:28:12.400
That woman? Really?

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.360
Your nephew has such a strange taste.

00:28:19.163 --> 00:28:22.640
I can't blame him, we have different definition of beauty.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.720
I think we should ask her about it.

00:28:27.897 --> 00:28:30.080
Excuse me, bill please?

00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:34.078
15 baht.

00:28:34.397 --> 00:28:35.650
Right, just a second.

00:28:42.357 --> 00:28:43.320
Wait.

00:28:45.263 --> 00:28:47.200
Isn't that Songsawat?

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.200
Yes, a sexy star.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.600
Isn't she the Field Marshal's latest mistress?

00:28:55.857 --> 00:28:59.760
That's right, they said that he fell head over heels for her.

00:29:09.897 --> 00:29:11.360
Lucky her.

00:29:19.243 --> 00:29:22.280
Saenkaew is quite something.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.041
He looks so innocent.

00:29:24.521 --> 00:29:26.522
But he's having an affair with the Field Marshal's mistress.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.911
Pin.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.200
What're you doing here? Who do I need to get changed?

00:30:33.241 --> 00:30:35.800
It'll be a big party at Rachawadee's night club.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.000
Sasin said that I need to take you there.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.321
What party?

00:30:50.357 --> 00:30:51.520
So pretty.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.600
How long have you been standing? Eat something?

00:30:57.703 --> 00:30:59.004
Not yet, I started to get tired.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.200
Sasin is there, let's go.

00:31:10.117 --> 00:31:11.840
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:12.063 --> 00:31:14.600
Prince Saenkaew, Pin, I'm glad you two could make it.

00:31:18.217 --> 00:31:21.640
Sure. What's the party?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.521
Can I get a big round of applause.

00:31:29.943 --> 00:31:31.720
Louder, please.

00:31:34.537 --> 00:31:36.880
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:31:37.123 --> 00:31:40.360
Everyone, the ceremony is about to begin.

00:31:40.623 --> 00:31:42.800
Please welcome a bride,

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.320
and a bride,

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.000
Wassana and Khaekhai.

00:32:02.803 --> 00:32:05.560
Kiss her!

00:32:05.737 --> 00:32:08.400
Kiss her!

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.600
More!

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.560
More!

00:32:20.737 --> 00:32:23.320
More!

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.480
They have been in love for years

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.600
so Ms. Rachawadee organized the wedding reception for them.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.320
Their families are fine with this?

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.360
Nope, that's why they needed to have it here.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.320
So it's just a fake wedding.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.480
Why did you say that?

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.680
You don't like it that they're in love?

00:33:58.481 --> 00:34:01.482
Nope, just feel bad.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.600
Their wedding only existed in a dream,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.840
dream that can never come true.

00:34:09.557 --> 00:34:11.241
I believe that it'll be true someday.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.960
No matter who we love

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.000
or what gender we are, society will accept them one day.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.320
They could get marriage certificate

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.320
and be legally bound.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.880
How could it be possible? Only in a dream.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.240
You insulted the dream again?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.800
I just live in a real world.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.880
For me, real world and dream are inseparable.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.001
Think about it,

00:34:51.317 --> 00:34:53.040
if we hadn't dreamed of flying like birds,

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.800
nobody would have come up with the idea of building a plane.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.960
I don't want to be drowning in sorrow of reality.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.920
I'd rather be dreaming and bringing it to life.

00:35:51.057 --> 00:35:52.160
I need to rest.

00:35:52.797 --> 00:35:53.798
Sure.

00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:56.200
- Please take care of her.
- Sure.

00:35:59.017 --> 00:36:00.960
- Pin…
- Pin, come on, let's dance.

00:36:03.897 --> 00:36:05.100
Why don't you dance with me?

00:36:24.243 --> 00:36:25.244
What?

00:36:30.517 --> 00:36:31.518
Nope.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.400
Come on, you're well-rested.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:37.851
Come on.

00:36:38.223 --> 00:36:40.160
Come here, let's go.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.121
Chansaeng.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.920
Saenkaew sneaked out to meet with Songsawat,
the Field Marshal's mistress?

00:38:01.183 --> 00:38:02.184
That's right.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.240
I was wondering why he acted so suspicious.

00:38:05.863 --> 00:38:09.520
Now I realized that he's having an affair
with the Field Marshal's mistress.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.600
Well, such a player.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.280
When did they meet?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.320
- How did they start dating?
- Oh, come on

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.960
you don't have to worry about that.

00:38:22.323 --> 00:38:24.800
Think about it, if this scandal leaks out,

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.520
Prince Bodin won't let his daughter marry Saenkaew for sure.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.100
And the Field Marshal could be so furious

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.800
and send someone to shot him

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.041
for messing with his woman.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.121
Two birds with one stone.

00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:43.760
What about this? I will spread

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.400
this hot rumor around town. Sounds good?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.120
Don't do anything stupid.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.240
If this is not true,

00:38:51.783 --> 00:38:54.160
it means that we're about to frame
the Field Marshal's woman,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.721
and you will be in trouble. This could lead to me.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.101
But I don't think

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.960
Saenkaew'd be stupid enough to date her.

00:39:06.683 --> 00:39:08.800
If it's not about this, what else could it be?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.400
It could be about

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.720
you causing a scene in the party,
and Prince Bodin was mad

00:39:13.763 --> 00:39:15.720
so Saenkaew sought for help from somewhere else.

00:39:16.463 --> 00:39:18.280
It…it's possible.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.560
No matter what,

00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:24.121
I still did a good job, didn't I?

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.360
You need to find out more about this,

00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:32.960
about their plan.

00:39:33.522 --> 00:39:36.440
Sure, I got you.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.600
- Sir?
- Come on in.

00:40:15.103 --> 00:40:16.040
What is it?

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.531
Sir?

00:40:17.897 --> 00:40:20.120
I went to make merit this morning

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.760
and this woman told me
that she worked for Ms. Songsawat

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.961
and she asked me to give you this letter.

00:40:35.643 --> 00:40:37.560
She asked to see me tonight.

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.240
Really?

00:40:45.383 --> 00:40:48.120
But Kamsu is watching you so close like this

00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:51.000
how do you plan to get out?

00:41:02.277 --> 00:41:03.840
Thank you so much, Mr. Consul.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.920
If you hadn't helped me out,

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.360
I wouldn't have been able to
transfer my assets to my Thai bank accounts.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.720
No worries, transferring assets in the bank

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.520
shouldn't be any trouble.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:19.040
I wish you the best with your plan.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.880
That was Mr. Consul, right?

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:38.400
You asked him to help
with transferring your assets, didn't you?

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.121
Someone tipped you off, huh?

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.280
Sorry,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.840
you can't stop me this time.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.080
Are you sure

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.960
that your son's fake wedding will be a success?

00:41:55.337 --> 00:41:59.080
I hope that nobody messed it up so bad
that you needed someone to help you out.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.681
You wouldn't think that I would let you embezzle

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.080
assets that are supposed to be belonged to nation easily.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.520
You know movements from my side so well,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.120
you got a spy, didn't you?

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.841
Is it Inthorn?

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.240
No wonder why a gambler like him

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.960
could cause a scene all the way in Bangkok.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.880
You're desperate that much,
you need to use someone like Inthorn?

00:42:35.877 --> 00:42:37.100
I could use anyone

00:42:37.517 --> 00:42:39.600
to maintain nation benefits.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.640
My brother betrayed his own blood.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.700
You think he wouldn't betray you?

00:42:49.457 --> 00:42:50.680
People said that

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.840
sewage flows to septic tank.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.360
I guess you and Inthorn get along really well.

00:43:27.457 --> 00:43:31.000
What should we do? Kamsu is guarding the door

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.360
for hours now.

00:43:49.217 --> 00:43:50.218
What should we do?

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.880
Mr. Kamsu, you have a long-distance call from Chansaeng.

00:44:12.143 --> 00:44:15.000
Sir, we're clear.

00:44:15.143 --> 00:44:16.144
You should go now.

00:44:31.623 --> 00:44:33.240
Prince Inthorn works for Kalong?

00:44:33.997 --> 00:44:36.800
That's right. I should have known about it sooner.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.400
Tell Saenkaew to be cautious.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:40.971
Yes, sir.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.010
I'll protecting him.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.800
And I won't let Prince Inthorn do anything.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.600
I don't think we have a problem about asset transferring.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.000
I'll be there when it's done.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.101
Take care of my son.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.761
Yes, sir.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:08.351
What is it?

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.000
Prince Kamfah called, I need to talk to Prince Saenkaew.

00:45:12.703 --> 00:45:15.920
He's not feeling well. He said that he had a headache.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.440
I gave him some pills and he just fell asleep.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.320
Call me when he wakes up.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.360
You all should spend the night here.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.040
I told Dao to prepare a room for you.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.700
Thank you.

00:45:48.823 --> 00:45:50.680
You brought us liquor

00:45:51.124 --> 00:45:53.240
- and you let us stay here.
- So very kind.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:54.920
Now you're nice to me.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.611
Sasin,

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.681
you should invite Prince Saenkaew to join us next time.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.320
The more the merrier.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.120
Sure, it will be fun.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.760
Prince Saenkaew didn't get drunk easily.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.800
- Really?
- You don't believe me, do you?

00:46:11.497 --> 00:46:14.320
He looks so innocent but he's good at drinking.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.800
We were so drunk, we barely stood up straight.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.880
But Saenkaew's eyes were still bright.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.530
He's totally fine.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.720
And he likes to act too serious.

00:46:31.677 --> 00:46:32.678
He likes to act furious

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.720
hoping that others would be afraid of him.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.080
Instead, he looks like a rabbit

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.921
and that's so funny.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.560
It seems like you're so fond of Prince Saenkaew.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.160
So much.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.801
He talks about Prince Saenkaew nonstop.

00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:58.280
Everyone falls for his charm.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:02.721
Sasin,

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.520
you can't fall for his charm, okay?

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.840
- What's wrong with you?
- Okay?

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.240
- Don't fall for his charm.
- Are you drunk?

00:47:11.683 --> 00:47:14.800
You're talking nonsense, here drink some more.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.840
So you can be quiet.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.301
Hello.

00:48:03.366 --> 00:48:06.600
I talked to the Field Marshal and you can meet him.

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.800
I'll take you to see him on Saturdays.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.000
Thank you so much.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.280
You should go.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.360
If someone see you with

00:48:18.477 --> 00:48:21.520
a moralless sexy star like me,
your reputation will be damaged.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.601
Wait,

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.920
is something bothering you?

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.520
You can tell me.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.680
I'm such a bad person,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.560
my face was so grumpy that you could tell.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.121
It's okay.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.081
So what is bothering you?

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.563
My little brother is getting married.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.171
There're just the two of us.

00:49:03.217 --> 00:49:04.500
But I don't think I can go.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:06.591
Why's that?

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.600
The woman's family is so strict,
they are somebody in society.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.521
They're so high in morals.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.280
If someone like me attends the reception,

00:49:16.657 --> 00:49:18.040
I'm afraid they would be embarrassed.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.400
But I think you should go.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.840
Your brother sent you the invitation.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.000
It means that he wants you on hig big day.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.501
Don't mind about the others, focus on your brother.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.881
Right?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.480
I wore this super tight swimsuit in my first film.

00:49:58.643 --> 00:50:00.320
And I needed to run from bad guys.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.000
Then my swimsuit cracked open.

00:50:02.283 --> 00:50:03.800
- What?
- Right in the middle of my chest.

00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:05.640
They kept the scene.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:08.720
That's the start of my career.

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.680
A sexy star of this era.

00:50:11.943 --> 00:50:13.480
This is destiny for sure,

00:50:14.343 --> 00:50:15.344
right?

00:50:15.883 --> 00:50:18.040
It's fun talking to you.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.600
I wouldn't let others come into my house.

00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:22.418
Why's that?

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.800
I met a lot of guys

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.880
and I can see from their eyes.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.360
They're either so horny or insulting me.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.801
But I don't feel like that with you.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.120
I feel like I'm talking to a friend.

00:50:40.517 --> 00:50:43.960
What? I thought we're already friends.

00:50:52.097 --> 00:50:53.783
If we're friends,

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.562
can I ask you something?

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.631
Sure.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.321
Actually, if you agree to marry Pin,

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.320
you can transfer your assets to her bank account,

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.280
your family can survive for sure.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.700
Why did you need to ask him
for his help storing your family's assets?

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:13.880
I see Pin as my own sister.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.280
I can't love her more than a sister.

00:51:19.597 --> 00:51:20.920
I don't want to use her.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.960
She deserves tp be married to a good guy,

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.800
not someone like me.

00:51:30.517 --> 00:51:32.880
But you're perfect.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.640
You have money and you're born in a good family.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.801
Not like that.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.880
I'm not perfect.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.000
There're so many things that I can't do.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.760
I can't live my life the way I want.

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:52.161
That's why I told you that I admired you

00:51:52.837 --> 00:51:53.920
for your bravery

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.480
to live your own life.

00:51:58.437 --> 00:51:59.438
You don't care about anyone.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.961
If the Field Marshal agrees to help you

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.760
and your plan is successful,

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.720
can I get one thing in return?

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.041
What is that?

00:52:18.641 --> 00:52:22.542
I want you to live your life like you want to.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:26.200
Be yourself.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.500
Be who you want to be.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.320
If I have a chance, I will try.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.280
I wouldn't dare to do it in the past.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.720
But someone once told me that

00:52:50.057 --> 00:52:52.200
I don't want to be drowning in sorrow of reality.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.960
I'd rather be dreaming and bringing it to life.

00:53:02.122 --> 00:53:03.200
Who said that?

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.681
Just someone I know.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:07.920
If they're just someone you know,

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.560
you wouldn't care that much about what they said.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.280
They must be someone important to you.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.120
I don't think we have enough.

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.480
Then get five more.

00:53:55.997 --> 00:53:57.480
- Don't you think it's too much.
- Just get more.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.100
- So hungry.
- Here, grill some more.

00:54:00.717 --> 00:54:01.718
You want some sticky rice?

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.440
- One for me.
- I don't want any.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.201
Two bags of sticky rice, please.

00:54:15.117 --> 00:54:16.118
Hey!

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:21.691
Hey!

00:54:23.157 --> 00:54:24.158
Where is he off to?

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.760
To the bathroom, I guess.

00:54:30.143 --> 00:54:31.044
Hey!

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.440
- What's this?
- How did you get here?

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.840
I should ask you this. You said
there's nothing between the two of you.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.240
- It's nothing.
- Liar.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.440
You're gonna admit when I saw you two sleeping together?

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:43.871
Hey!

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.761
Stop with that nasty thought of yours.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.320
You're insulting me and Ms. Songsawat.

00:54:48.541 --> 00:54:51.760
Then tell me, why did you walk out
of her house in the morning?

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.521
You spent the night here, of course you're having an affair with her.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.500
Tell me, what is it?

00:55:03.423 --> 00:55:05.223
I asked her to make an appointment
with the Field Marshal for me.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.320
I'd ask him to help me with assets transferring.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:10.680
If everything goes according to plan,

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.480
Pin and I don't have to get married.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.081
You don't want to get married?

00:55:17.857 --> 00:55:18.858
Why?

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.040
She deserves someone better than me.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.000
Why didn't you tell her? You know that she loves you.

00:55:27.121 --> 00:55:28.122
I'm sorry.

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.041
I don't want it to be this way.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.263
I try to find solutions.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.681
Solutions of what?

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.440
This is your excuse.

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.920
You and your dad are horrible people, so selfish.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.960
You did everything for your own benefits.

00:55:42.157 --> 00:55:43.720
You don't care about others.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.760
You felt bad for your mom because you're a horrible son?

00:55:48.183 --> 00:55:49.700
- Hey!
- Why?

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.121
I heard you talked in your sleep.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.560
I felt bad for you at first

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.760
but now I get it.

00:55:57.497 --> 00:55:59.103
You're irresponsible.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.600
You're selfish, you're using people.

00:56:01.863 --> 00:56:03.280
That's why your mom left you.

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:08.801
Hey!

00:56:34.897 --> 00:56:37.280
Saenkaew wanted to ask the Field Marshal for his help.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.800
Why didn't he want to get married?

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.241
That way is easier.

00:56:43.477 --> 00:56:44.478
I know, right?

00:56:45.497 --> 00:56:46.598
Why's that?
