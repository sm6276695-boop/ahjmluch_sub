Rey!

Print!

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.480
We...

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.040
switched back?!

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.080
Please give a round of applause
to Miss Print and Miss Rey

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.760
for their exclusive show!

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.120
Hey!

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640
Print, you okay?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.360
Rey?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.960
Mai, I...

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.240
She's not Rey.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.680
Don't tell me that you guys...

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.640
Switched back?

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.440
Rey.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Mother!

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.560
I miss you so much.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.000
We just met last night, didn't we?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.280
Come home with me today, then.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.440
I have some updates for you.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.400
I got a call from a Chinese agency.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.520
With one condition:

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.280
you need to cancel
all your work in Thailand.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.960
What about the project
I just took on with Print?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.840
I'd better schedule a meeting
between you and the agency.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280
That way you'll know
it's truly for the best.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.120
Rey!

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.080
Uh...

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.520
I'm going home.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.440
Let's go home.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.960
I'll be waiting in the car, Miss.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.960
Do you like these flowers?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.160
Thank you.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.040
Is there good news
you haven't told me?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.280
I'm just happy
the event today went smoothly.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.360
Speaking of which,
what news do you have for me?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080
I've scheduled a meeting
with the Chinese agency.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.800
They'll be flying here
to have a talk with you soon.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.920
The Chinese agency?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720
The one we discussed last night, dear.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.960
Hello, my beloved brother, Frank.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120
Hey, are Mom and Patty with you?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.840
Come on, turn on the camera.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.160
- Patty.
- Hm?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.920
Frank, why would you turn it on?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.040
I told him to.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.120
I want to see your lovely faces.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.280
That's odd of you.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.200
Is there something going on?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.400
I just really miss you guys

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.640
and Thai barbeque!

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.640
Since Jake's flying here
the day after tomorrow,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.400
should we eat Thai barbeque again?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.240
Jake?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.240
Jake who?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.480
What's the matter with her?

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.400
I'm sorry

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.520
I haven't told you this from the start.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.320
I'm afraid you'd be worried.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.680
Why would I be?

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.560
It's your happiness, after all.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.840
I'll take you to meet him sometime.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.080
This is not how yesterday went.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.800
Didn't we
already talk to her about this?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.560
Is there anything
you haven't told me, Rey?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.520
Is there anything

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.760
you haven't told me, Print?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.720
About the Chinese agency,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760
why did you decide on your own

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.360
without even asking me?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.720
It's your future, Rey.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.560
How could I even say no?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.680
You don't even have to.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.240
All it took was to discuss it with me,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.760
and let me be the one
making the decision.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.000
Is that so hard?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.840
This is my life.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.400
Rey, you didn't tell me
about my mom either!

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.440
That's my family.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.400
I've been trying to find
the right time to do so!

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.080
It's not the end of the world

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.120
if your mom has a new boyfriend!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.880
It might be nothing to you, Rey,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.960
but not for me.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.560
That's my mom we're talking about.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.600
She's not a child!

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.760
She knows what she's doing!

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.600
If she's found real love,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.880
shouldn't you be happy for her?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.400
What if it's not real love, Rey?

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.600
What if her heart is broken again?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.280
You'd never understand

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.880
how I have to be
the main pillar of the house,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.480
carrying everything on my shoulders.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.920
You could never imagine
how guilty I'd feel

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
seeing my family heartbroken!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.480
But do you have any clue

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.720
how uncomfortable
everyone in your family is

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.680
because of
your so-called good intentions?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.400
All this time,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.800
you must've really been
uncomfortable with me.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.040
I heard that loud and clear.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.800
I believe I saw you
driving off somewhere last night.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.400
I have some business to take care of.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.800
Try not to get sick during this time.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.280
Mother,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.560
I'm...not so sure
about the Chinese agency.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.480
Have my decisions
ever wronged you, dear?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
Print!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.320
Come talk this out with me now!

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720
Print!

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480
Print!

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.360
Print?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360
Print!

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.520
Rey, don't get any closer,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.240
or you'll catch a cold.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.520
You have the energy
to worry about others now?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.360
Whoa, you're burning up.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.480
It's cold!

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.800
Just bear with it.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.760
This will cool you down.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.760
Isn't this too soon?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040
Why?

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.720
I'm a grown woman.
I can do whatever I want.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.160
I'm not gonna
dance around it like kids do.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.960
Plus, I don't think
you'd invite me here for dinner

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.800
without making me your dessert.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.600
What kind of person am I in your eyes?

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.960
It's a genuine dinner.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.320
Nothing else?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.000
Mm-hm,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.640
I have something important to discuss.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.400
- Mai...
- Hm?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.320
You don't have to do all this.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.160
It's just a dinner date at home.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.040
You made it feel like
a fine dining restaurant...

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.760
This is how I normally do it.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.240
I'll dig right in, then!

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.360
Yum!

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.760
What's with the staring?

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.760
I just wanna know how you feel

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.520
dining with a disciplinarian like me.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.880
I'm not uncomfortable or anything.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.200
Just don't complain if I make a mess.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.680
What if it's not just dining together?

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.440
If you woke up
to the sight of me every day,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.040
what would you say?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.960
Are you asking me to move in with you?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.560
Whoa, isn't it...

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.240
too soon?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.280
It's your own words,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.120
"I'm a grown woman.
I can do whatever I want.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.360
I'm not gonna
dance around it like kids do."

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
Well,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400
if a disciplinarian like you

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.960
sees me spilling water
all over the table every day,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.360
can you handle it?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.960
One more kiss, please?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.960
I didn't even know you cared.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.800
I thought you were uncomfortable.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.720
I'm sorry.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.400
I never once feel
uncomfortable around you.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.640
Could we please make up?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.160
"Babe."

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.440
I feel really bad.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.280
I'm sorry.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720
Babe?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.760
So you're not gonna drop it?

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.760
Okay,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.840
I guess I'm leaving.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.400
Ah, wait a minute!

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.760
I'm sorry.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.200
I really am!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.800
I'm really, really sorry!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.840
I'm sorry, babe.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.720
I'm sorry!

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.560
What are you doing?

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.560
I'm making it up to you, Rey.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
Don't you like it?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.800
I suppose your fever's gone now.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.760
Well, I've got a good nurse

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.160
scaring the fever away.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.800
Now that we've switched back,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.480
why don't you
take good care of yourself

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.520
like you did in my body?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.520
Be mindful of your health,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.200
and don't ever get sick again.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.800
Do you hear me?

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280
I do!

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.640
But I'm not saying

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.040
that I'll only take good care of myself

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.640
because I...

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.520
will also take good care of you.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.240
It's nice that we switched back.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.120
I get to adore your face this closely.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.080
Do you remember how I told you

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.960
I was jealous of your beauty?

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.600
I no longer feel that way.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.640
I've come to really like it.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.240
Your eyebrows...

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.760
Your eyes...

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480
Your nose...

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.520
And your lips.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.120
I love everything

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.440
you said you didn't like about yourself.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.440
Look who's burning up now.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.720
Are you teasing me?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.480
You'll regret it!

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.480
Waking up to you in my arms

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.520
is a hundred times better
than waking up alone.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.920
Then...

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.920
don't get mad at me again, Print.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.640
Mm.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.240
Could we promise

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.400
we'd never fight like we did again?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.760
Mm, I promise.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.200
I won't keep
any more secrets from you,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.520
and I won't ever
run away from problems again.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.960
Sis, are you really not gonna meet him?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.120
I think...

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.000
you should go meet him for a bit.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.560
No way.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.920
If I do,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.000
it's gonna be such a pain.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.840
Ow!

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.720
That hurts!

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.880
You just promised a second ago

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.560
you wouldn't run away
from problems.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.880
You said it yourself

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.960
I should be happy for her new love.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.680
But I just...

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.560
couldn't be happy

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.480
that someone's gonna replace Dad.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.120
If he really was an awful man,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.040
would you just let him get away with it?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.680
Nuh-uh! No way!

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.920
Not in a million years I'd let him live.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.840
I appreciate you coming, Print.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.520
Where's the guy?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.400
Your foreign boyfriend?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.080
Did he know I was coming,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.000
so he cried back to his home country?

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.800
Good thing Jake didn't fall over.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.080
Why didn't you help him, Frank?!

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.480
Uh...

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.360
Print, this is Jake.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.840
Hello, my name is Jake.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.720
Thank you.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.400
Mom,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.560
where is he from, anyway?

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.040
How did you meet him?

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.080
Oh,

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.240
I met Jake
when he traveled here three years ago.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.520
He worked in the States,

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.680
but he's now retired.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.640
Oh!

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.120
I...will get a new pair myself.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.280
Retired?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.280
How would he take care
of his living expenses?

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.520
Don't tell me
he's gonna be asking you for money.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.720
He has his own savings, sweetie.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.760
Plus, he wants to move here.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.280
"That's right,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.720
because I wish to be close to Rapee."

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.120
"I want to take care of Rapee."

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.880
I guess
all your worries are gone by now.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.640
Someone's taking care of your mom.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.800
Sorry! Sorry...

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.600
I will take care of this!

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.600
Don't worry.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.000
Don't worry.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.160
Look at him.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.240
Can't even take care of himself.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.520
I'm guessing the person
who changed her mind

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.960
is you, isn't it?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.200
Why do you think so?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.920
Well, Print is the kind
who never changes her mind,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.680
except when someone talks her out of it.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
Gossiping about me?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.040
Nope, never.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.320
- Right, Patty?
- Mm! Who'd do that?

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.680
Frank, Patty, just go.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.520
Mom's calling you guys
from the outside.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.320
I'll take care of this.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.000
That's awesome, Sis.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.960
I was just starting to feel a cramp.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.320
Let's go, Patty.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360
Shoo!

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.760
After we wipe all these dishes,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.040
let's go home.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.240
Already?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.360
But you've only been here
for a few hours.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.040
Long enough to know he's tacky!

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.520
He looks like a good-for-nothing.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.600
How could I trust my family with him?

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.800
Print,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.720
are you sure that is enough

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.880
to judge his worth for your mom?

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.240
Hm...

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.600
Look at us.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.200
We've known each other for years,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.200
but it took a long time for us

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.240
to really get to know each other.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.560
Everyone,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.480
Print cut up some fruit for you.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.560
Thanks, dear.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.600
I did cut some for Jake.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.440
Where is he?

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.280
He's probably over there.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.680
Grab him for me, would you?

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.080
Okay.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.440
- Here, take a seat.
- Let's eat.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.480
- Eat with us.
- Thank you.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.760
Here, Rey.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.800
Hey!

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.280
What are you doing
with my dad's motorbike?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.400
Uh...

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.840
I just thought
it's probably out of order...

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.680
You don't have any rights
to touch things around my house!

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.760
Print!

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.760
What's wrong?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.800
Ask your boyfriend

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.600
who he thinks he is,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.200
messing with Dad's stuff.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.480
Do you know how important
that motorbike is to me, Rey?

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.360
Dad saved up money for it

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.000
to take us to school,

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.440
take us to different places,

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.680
and bring us to camp.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.280
Nowadays,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.320
whenever I ride
that motorbike to places,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.480
I feel as though Dad accompanies me,

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.880
as if he's still right next to me.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.760
I don't get a damn thing.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.360
Why does Mom
feel the need to replace Dad?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.400
No one could ever replace anybody.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.080
I don't like this at all!

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.560
I believe

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.440
Auntie, Jake, and your siblings

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.600
are also on the same page.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.240
Auntie once told me

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.960
she still missed your dad every day,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.120
so she came to this place

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.000
where she met Jake.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.480
He was here when she did

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.760
because he missed his late wife.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.880
He and his spouse
promised they'd take a trip here,

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.680
but they never made it together.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.640
You're saying that...

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.040
Jake also lost his wife?

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.080
Mm.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.720
Do you know

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.360
what two people
who can't forget their lost lovers do?

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.800
They share those memories
with each other,

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.320
instead of letting them fade away.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:18.680
Rey, do you think Jake can comfort her?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.800
I'm not saying that.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.560
I think you should see it for yourself.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920
All done!

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.280
Jake!

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.600
Oh, you're back?

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.760
Just in time, I fixed the motorbike.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.520
Didn't you disassemble it?

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.200
I was trying to fix it up,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.240
but seeing how old it is,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.320
I took it apart to get a better look.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.960
Have you two eaten anything?

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.400
Not yet, Auntie.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.480
Okay, then, let's eat.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.120
- Mm!
- Come on, honey.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Let's go eat.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.400
I'm getting hungry.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.480
Come on.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.320
Here you go!

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.680
It's absolutely delicious, Auntie!

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.360
Print!

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.920
I'm not gonna save any for you.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.960
Fine.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560
How is it?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.480
Is it as good as you remember?

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.400
Mm, it's heavenly.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.440
Jake even helped me out in the kitchen.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120
Print...

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.120
Jake,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.840
do you really love my mom?

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.840
Say it in front of Dad

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.280
because if you dare to lie,

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.760
I'll have Dad haunt you

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.960
back to the States.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.120
Alright.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.560
I love Rapee,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.080
and I want to take care of her.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:39.960
I swear in front of your father

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.240
that I won't ever hurt her.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.240
If I break my words,

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.800
he can come and haunt me,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.520
and you can curse at me
for 7 days and 7 nights.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.040
Gosh,

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.520
with all that yapping,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.840
you must be Thai.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.640
Your Thai is really good.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.400
Who's your teacher?

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.280
He learned it all by himself

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.080
so that he can talk to you guys.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
Pretty fluent, right?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.320
Thank you so much

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.040
for moo chamuang

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.640
and for fixing the motorbike.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.520
From now on, please take care of Mom.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.040
I will.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.840
Welcome, Jake.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.840
Jake!

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.920
Thank you!

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.800
Yay!

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.360
Thank you so much, Print.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.400
Guys, should we go camping together?

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.760
Bet!

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.400
We haven't done it since Dad passed.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.840
Mm, let's go.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.080
Yes!

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.240
Jake, would you come with us?

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.440
I'd love to.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.920
Yay!

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.320
Another reminder:

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.600
I snore in my sleep.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.680
If you get annoyed
in the middle of the night

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.240
and kick me out,
just know I'm not leaving.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.000
Okay!

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.840
Since this is your first night
moving in with me...

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.840
what'd you say
if we do something pleasurable?

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.040
I'd say I'm down.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.400
This?

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.880
Your definition of pleasure?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.240
And what did you think it was?

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.600
Hm...

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.440
I don't know.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.160
Maybe...

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.320
meditation?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.840
With you lying next to me,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.640
I don't have the heart to meditate.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880
No need to turn it off.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.840
I like it like that.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.960
Well, well.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.760
You've always made Thai barbeque,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.200
but now that you're dating a foreigner,

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.360
you're making real barbeque, Mom?

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.040
Woohoo!

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.600
Aw...

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.840
You also have something here.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960
Sis,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.760
Patty has something to ask.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.360
Wait, aren't you
the one wanting to know?

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.720
You ask!

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.680
No, you ask!

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.920
Alright, just shoot
whatever questions you have,

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.240
and stop arguing!

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880
So...

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.560
You and Rey...

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.840
What is your relationship?

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.640
Why did you just blurt it out like that?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.960
Well, she took Rey home,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.320
and yesterday, I saw...

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.520
Gosh, just say it.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.400
You saw them kissing!

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.320
My, my!

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.960
Rey and I...

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.560
We...

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.040
We're...dating.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.000
What, Mom?
Why are you so surprised?!

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.120
Nothing! I just...

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.440
never knew you liked girls.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.360
It's nothing strange, Mom.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.120
I also...like girls.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.240
- Huh?
- What?!

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.400
For real?!

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.840
Alright,

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.520
I'm gonna love whoever you guys love.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.080
So that means
all my children like girls, right?

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.440
I'll have three daughters-in-law!

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.400
Nothing's set in stone, Mom.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.440
Right?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.480
Right.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.040
What do we have here?

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080
Tell me!

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960
Nope.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.280
It's a secret.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.880
Guys,

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.960
here's my boyfriend, Auer.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.560
Hi, Auer!

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.120
Whenever you have time,
come with Frank to meet me, alright?

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.720
Let's have Thai barbeque!

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.320
Of course, Mom.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.640
I appreciate it.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.240
It's very nice to meet you.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.880
You're a handsome young man!

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.120
See you guys soon.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040
Bye!

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.640
That's Orion.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400
His head...

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.040
Here, look!

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200
You see that?

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.600
How pretty!

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.800
The stars?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.480
Uh-uh.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.440
Do you know
when I told them about us,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600
my heart was beating out of my chest!

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Why so?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.440
Were you afraid
they wouldn't accept me?

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.960
Uh-uh, it's not that.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.840
Bringing a partner home
for the first time

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.240
always gets people nervous, doesn't it?

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.880
For real, though, when I realized
how accepting my family was,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:51.520
I was on cloud nine!

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.920
This must be how Mom felt

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:01.080
when she knew I opened up to Jake.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.160
Aren't you afraid
I'm gonna be her new favorite child?

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.880
I'll just give up now.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840
Only if...

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.480
you're titled
"The Best Daughter-In-Law."

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.880
Silly you!

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.560
We have a meeting with
the Chinese agency tomorrow evening.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.720
Are you good?

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.120
Do you want me to go to China, Print?

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.760
Hm...

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.840
Honestly, I don't want you
to go to China or anything.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.680
The thought of being far from you

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.400
makes me wanna tear up!

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.640
Waa!

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.560
But I don't wanna be
that one selfish person

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.480
who ruins your future.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.000
So, I want you
to be the one who decides.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.520
Though, no matter what your decision is,

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.440
you have my full support.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.000
No matter how far you go,

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.400
no matter how long you take,

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.480
I'll be right here for you.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.400
I think I have the answer.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.280
Hi, Auntie!

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.040
Rey,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.360
why didn't you tell me
that you invited Print home?

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.680
You're gonna have to take
a shower and get dressed.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.960
I don't think we have time for guests.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.800
It's alright.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.800
I'm just here to give you my answer.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.600
Mother,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.440
I've been carefully contemplating this.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.280
I'm not going to China.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.560
Rey,

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.600
I told you to meet them first;

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.360
otherwise, I won't consider
this a proper answer.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.280
My answer
won't be any different from now.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.320
The reason you're refusing

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.360
is that you want to be
with Print, isn't it?

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.880
I can tell

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.200
that you two aren't just friends.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.440
If this is how much
you've changed after being with her,

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.520
I don't think she's the one for you.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.720
Print has nothing
to do with my decision.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.840
She only supports me
to choose my own path,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.320
but that path of mine
doesn't lead to China.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.240
I'd better go wait outside...

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.880
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.120
Rey,

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.560
I think you should go back
to talk it out with Auntie.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.360
I've thought this over, Print.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.440
But are you sure
you decided for yourself,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.000
and not for me?

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.920
Trust me.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.000
I decided to be here truly for myself.

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.360
Mm!

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.480
Rey!

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.920
If you walk away any further,

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.360
I will disown you.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.920
Please return this to Father.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.400
Rey!

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.040
I want you to find something for me.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.480
Anything that can stir the media.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.160
What made you wake up
to prepare the flowers now?

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.280
I just realized

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320
that I haven't paid respect to your dad.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.160
Dad,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.920
my name is Rey, Print's girlfriend.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.440
Your daughter's
always worried about others,

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.800
so much so that she sometimes
forgets about herself, right?

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.560
Are you paying respect to my dad,

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.080
or are you actually snitching?

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.120
Shh!

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.560
From now on,
please have no worries.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.160
I'll take care of Print.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.480
No matter what the future holds,

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.520
I won't ever let go of her hands.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.440
I'm blushing in front of Dad.
