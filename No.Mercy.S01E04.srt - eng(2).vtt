WEBVTT

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.144
(Lee Joo Young)

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ji Seung Hyun)

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.932
(Koo Jun Hoe)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.810
(Mom)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:50.050
(No Mercy)

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.053
(All characters, organizations, groups,)

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.054
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.725
The Samhaphoe guys
wouldn't have just sat back.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.093
So how'd you handle it?

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.564
We made a deal for steady supply,

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.799
high-purity product.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.034
Less risky,

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.037
and we cut the middlemen.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.739
Can you get bulk quantities?

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.908
Twenty kilos have already come through.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.144
Fifty more coming next month.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.216
We're finally looking at decent money.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:23.417
Yes, sir.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:24.685
Here.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.053
Good work.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.867
Thank you.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:41.368
Thank you, sir.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.747
Any progress on Singapore?

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:55.883
Thanks to your backing,

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.851
looks like we'll close the deal soon.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:02.523
Seok Gu.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.157
You ever think about...

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.361
how many people had to work...

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:10.297
just to get this one spoonful of rice
on my table?

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:12.599
From growing the rice,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.501
to selling it, distributing it,

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.570
and cooking it.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.307
It goes through countless hands
before reaching my table.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:22.776
But in the end,

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.614
no matter how hard they worked,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.883
none of that matters...

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.418
if I don't pick up this spoon.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.787
Look.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.923
Until I pick up my spoon,

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.624
you can't eat either.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.598
That's power.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:49.503
Haven't you figured it out?

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.306
Your parents spent their whole lives
serving my family.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.642
You can look up at the sky all you want,

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:58.912
but it won't change your position.

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:03.917
After all, we were born and raised
in completely different worlds.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.654
Yes, sir.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.868
That old bastard still thinks...

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.037
I'm some stray dog living off his charity.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:31.945
Let's see who ends up...

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.716
on their knees,

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:37.751
groveling at my feet.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.219
Okay?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.796
(No Mercy)

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.942
It must've been rough
coming all the way here.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.546
I'm Ma Seok Gu. Good to meet you.

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.517
That mom you're looking for?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.687
She's right there with you. Look around.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.036
Son of a bitch.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.378
Ms. Wei Chang Yu?

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.423
(Episode 4)

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:51.558
Thank you.

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.232
Have we met before?

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.267
You look familiar.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:02.970
I know that face.

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.006
Tell me the truth.
We've met before, right?

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.577
Wouldn't it be weird...

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.214
if I said we hadn't?

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:16.350
It makes no sense to say...

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.418
we've never crossed paths...

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.454
in such a small world.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.591
Especially since we share the same roots.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.494
Right.

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:29.963
If you worked for Park Gye Soon,

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:32.266
we must've crossed paths sometime.

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.369
Let's talk more inside.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:52.986
Hello, I'm Kim Mi Yang,

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.122
always here by your side
for your job search.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.092
I completely understand.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.494
I'd like to send you a product...

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:02.563
with the same care as a mother would.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.064
Is now a good time?

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:06.967
News says...

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.469
they're using voice technology
to catch us.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.305
So I got smart.

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.208
One voice, perfect disguise.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.010
So I borrowed your mom.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:19.847
Hi, I'm Kim Mi Yang,
your trusty hiring manager.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.715
- How can I help you today?
- I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:23.150
I understand.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.318
I've got a great product...

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:25.819
I'd like to recommend.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.689
You're in on this too, right?

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.559
That crazy Kim Mi Yang
turned my son into a criminal.

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.494
Mom!

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:38.198
What do I do?

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:49.443
Your verification is complete.

00:06:58.886 --> 00:06:59.686
First off,

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.257
I did some digging into you,
Ms. Wei Chang Yu.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.728
But anyone can forge documents like this,

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:08.962
so I can't fully trust it.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.369
This piece of paper won't convince me.

00:07:16.103 --> 00:07:17.371
Let me cut to the chase.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.575
Why did Park Gye Soon's person
come crawling in here?

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.279
She just wanted to share what she had.

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:31.385
Let's say you're stranded
on an island with a friend.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.389
You're starving for days,

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.592
then suddenly a pig shows up.

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.896
What would you do?

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.799
How would you handle it?

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.635
You'd have to kill your friend then.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.638
So you can have the pig all to yourself.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.610
Park Gye Soon didn't get that.

00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.712
She's too busy sharing.

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:04.117
At the end of the day,
you took it all from her, didn't you?

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:07.988
Even her life.

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.591
That's why you betrayed the group
that raised you...

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:11.692
and came here?

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:13.827
After more than a decade? Just like that?

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:20.300
That means you could
stab me in the back anytime.

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:22.636
To me,

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:25.906
you're not my friend. You're the pig.

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:29.443
Why is that?

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:30.744
If you kill your friend,

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.848
people just point fingers, then it's over.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:36.383
But...

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:40.187
no one in their right mind
would cut open a pig...

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.789
after raising its worth so high.

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:46.627
This thing about greed...

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:49.696
once you feed it, it just keep growing.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.400
Since I've got the skills,

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:57.738
so I should fatten up the pig properly.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.241
The bigger it gets,

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:03.277
the more satisfying it'll be.

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:04.178
So basically,

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.215
you'll fatten me up...

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:11.151
and sell me at my highest value.

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.130
Holding back hunger...

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.831
for the product's future value.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.835
I love the sound of that.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.904
But...

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:36.910
Why are you doing this?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.413
You did your homework on what I like,

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:41.882
but I told you. I don't trust easily.

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.953
I don't trust papers,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.622
and I sure won't fall for smooth speeches.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.491
Tell me straight.

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:53.694
Who sent you?

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:56.363
How can I make you believe me?

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.934
Prove you're not a double agent yourself.

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.137
That's where I'll begin trusting you.

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:23.924
Ever heard of the Heungsami clan?

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:27.461
This guy is their spy.

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:29.863
Hey.

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.606
This is the Ilseong clan.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.876
And this one is the Heungsami clan.

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:45.112
They're the top dogs
in northeastern China.

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:46.780
That's them.

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:09.236
I'm curious to see.

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:11.038
In the end, let's see who goes down,

00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:12.606
me or her.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.075
The choice is yours.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:16.810
I'll be waiting.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:21.615
I'm working my ass off because of someone,

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.151
and you still have time to think.

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:26.286
I'm sorry, chief.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.922
Once we wrap up the investigation on
Lee Seung Tae,

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.357
we'll hand him over to the prosecutors.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:31.925
Case closed.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.360
Wait, chief.

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:35.662
Did Lee Seung Tae talk about...

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.698
where the Ilseong clan's base is?

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.132
That punk doesn't know anything.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.603
The only thing he knew in Korea was
where the captain lived.

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:44.771
But that guy vanished too.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.708
Looks like they threw some small fish
under the bus...

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:49.910
to protect the big guy.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:52.613
What's the point of nabbing the small fry?

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:54.615
Will they even get punished properly?

00:11:57.784 --> 00:11:59.152
They do their time, get out,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.022
and they're square with the law.

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:03.390
That's not justice.

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:05.859
That's just killing time
until they're back on the streets.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.835
What's going on?

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:21.074
It makes sense.

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:24.178
I almost turned into a papa's boy.

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:26.180
Thank you, sir.

00:12:27.814 --> 00:12:28.782
I'm leaving.

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:30.417
Hey.

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:32.352
Where the hell do you think you're going?

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.910
(Evidence storage room)

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:50.130
Here's where they kept it.

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.143
(The crackdown on
voice phishing operations)

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.885
Sorry for being rude earlier,
especially since we know each other.

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:15.355
You must be hungry after the long trip.

00:14:15.756 --> 00:14:17.024
Have some meat.

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.664
Feed that to Happy.

00:14:29.837 --> 00:14:32.606
Hey, you're lucky as hell today, right?

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.876
Eat up while it's fresh.

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.516
To bring you in,

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:44.952
I needed to know you're on my side.

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:47.754
You're obviously talented,

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.557
so I was getting impatient.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:58.332
Honey,

00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:01.502
my phone died, so I borrowed
a temporary one from the store.

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:03.370
It's text-only.

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:06.406
You should've been more careful.

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.409
I've got a work call coming up.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.911
So I need to get a new phone fast.

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.248
Yeah, that's just how it is.

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:17.451
Problem is,

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:19.953
I need my ID to activate it,

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.422
and I forgot my wallet.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.527
Take photos of both sides of my ID...

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:28.095
and text them over.

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.531
Man,

00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.833
Can't believe pieces of shit like this
are still out there.

00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:34.001
Don't you agree, everyone?

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:37.838
It's hard to believe scum like this
still exists.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:44.411
So you really did send those pictures?

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:45.379
Yes.

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.715
Later, the bank called my husband,

00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:52.019
asking if he really moved all $60,000

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.321
from our account.

00:15:54.755 --> 00:15:55.622
Everyone.

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.959
the scammers used...

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.260
the victim's ID photos...

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.196
to set up mobile banking.

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.098
The problem is,

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:08.302
then they can pull out big money easily.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:13.874
It reveals the weak spots
in the financial companies'

00:16:13.874 --> 00:16:15.642
digital services.

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:18.879
Thanks to you,

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.448
numbers have been through the roof.

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:24.184
But now that it's blown up,

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.620
everyone's going to copy us.

00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:28.622
In that case,

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:31.325
it's time for a fresh approach.

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:32.960
Right?

00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:35.395
We've got...

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.432
a new motto.

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:42.002
Bleed each target dry.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:44.371
Volume and small scores are...

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:46.507
for the amateurs at the call center.

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:48.942
We recruited you,

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.912
so show us what you got.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.951
I'll do my best.

00:16:58.785 --> 00:16:59.653
Good.

00:17:01.588 --> 00:17:04.625
Let's fatten up the pig real good.

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.026
Okay?

00:17:11.632 --> 00:17:13.033
It's all...

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.602
about the intel, not the skills.

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:20.207
Everyone uses this database.

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:25.345
So we need a different angle, right?

00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:31.818
This is the database we'll be using.

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:34.588
Likes,

00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:35.989
favorite foods,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.524
hobbies,

00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:38.792
special skills,

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:40.494
voice tone,

00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:41.995
and speaking style.

00:17:42.262 --> 00:17:43.864
Kim has disappeared.

00:17:44.932 --> 00:17:46.700
Really? Since when?

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:49.236
Since before the illegal gambling house
got exposed,

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.572
so it's been over a week.

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.976
That son of a bitch is hiding money
from me?

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:57.911
Isn't it a bit strange?

00:17:58.145 --> 00:17:58.912
Strange how?

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:02.583
Why did she come through Mr. Kim,
of all people?

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:05.485
It could happen.

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:07.354
The day she joined the call center,

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:10.224
the Korean handler was caught,

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:12.926
and Mr. Kim disappeared too.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.395
He's now on the wanted list.

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.331
Something's off, right?

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:21.301
Dig deeper on Wei Chang Yu.

00:18:22.402 --> 00:18:24.505
Use solid sources.

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:25.472
Check everything.

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:26.907
Yes, sir.

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:30.744
With just the internet,

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:33.547
we can easily figure this out.

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:36.884
So, using deep voice...

00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:37.918
Deep voice is...

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:41.021
a method we've always used,
and you know it.

00:18:41.021 --> 00:18:43.257
That's not it.
What I'm trying to say is...

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:44.791
Our team lead told me...

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:47.561
you're great at finding
people's weak spots.

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:50.264
Let me ask one thing.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:53.267
What's my weakness then?

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.336
If you worked for Park Gye Soon,

00:18:57.171 --> 00:18:58.805
you must've learned something.

00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:04.044
Are there any old phones...

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.079
or tablets?

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:08.415
(Build number)

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:20.460
Phone, please.

00:19:36.143 --> 00:19:38.212
If devices logged into the same account...

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.547
are in China and Korea,

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:42.482
a call from China...

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:44.351
shows up as a Korean number.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.990
Cops caught on.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.258
This trick's dead.

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:54.862
It's dead?

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:57.631
Thailand's been doing this for a while.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.034
If we can't get ahead of others,

00:20:02.402 --> 00:20:04.471
we at least can't fall behind, right?

00:20:08.408 --> 00:20:10.377
Let's take a short break.

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:25.058
Make an obituary...

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:26.894
and put it up here.

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:32.266
Isn't this a fancy apartment complex?

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:33.267
How do we handle it?

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:44.044
You clearly know what you're doing.

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:45.646
The lighter...

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:48.348
or the work?

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:52.586
What's your game?

00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:56.390
Tell me what you want from me.

00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.093
I want to hold a position here.

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:07.434
Yeah, that look.

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.736
It wasn't ordinary from day one.

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:13.273
I really like it.

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.109
For a deal like that,

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.712
prove yourself with performance.

00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:20.881
Instead of begging outright like this,

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:23.417
make me look for your help.

00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:26.453
That's much classier.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.225
Proving with performance is...

00:21:32.426 --> 00:21:34.394
only natural.

00:21:47.975 --> 00:21:49.643
(Obituary)

00:21:50.711 --> 00:21:51.979
(Message sent)

00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:56.016
What?

00:21:56.016 --> 00:21:56.950
Nice timing.

00:22:01.288 --> 00:22:02.956
(Two unread messages)

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.659
So Min made it to China after all.

00:22:06.193 --> 00:22:07.160
Awesome.

00:22:07.561 --> 00:22:08.395
Yeah.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.497
Let's see what we can do.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:12.132
(Connection failed)

00:22:12.132 --> 00:22:14.635
We infected the phone
and turned it into a zombie phone.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.705
The phone I'm handling...

00:22:18.705 --> 00:22:20.908
has no real personal data.

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:23.110
It seems like a secondary phone.

00:22:23.911 --> 00:22:25.012
All I see are...

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:28.148
idol photos.

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:30.250
Remember what I said?

00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:34.054
This is the time for a pro...

00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:35.989
to find a way in.

00:22:41.195 --> 00:22:43.630
Want me to do a demo?

00:22:44.331 --> 00:22:47.467
What we do is
customer satisfaction service.

00:22:47.968 --> 00:22:49.736
Understand the clients' needs...

00:22:49.736 --> 00:22:51.705
and meet them completely.

00:22:51.905 --> 00:22:53.040
The key is...

00:22:53.307 --> 00:22:55.442
natural connection.

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:58.378
The easiest way is to let them sleep.

00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:02.649
Make it feel like a dream, not real life.

00:23:06.787 --> 00:23:09.423
Then they're bound to pay...

00:23:10.924 --> 00:23:12.659
for the service on their own.

00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:19.666
(Lee Gi Myung)

00:23:20.234 --> 00:23:21.301
Hold on.

00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:22.135
Okay.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.941
Hello?

00:23:28.342 --> 00:23:29.810
Hi, Mr. Lee Gi Myung.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.813
This is Cho Hwa Young
from Howl Coffee's event team speaking.

00:23:32.813 --> 00:23:34.915
You applied for Rosanna's fan meeting,

00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:37.217
but unfortunately, you didn't get chosen.

00:23:37.684 --> 00:23:40.254
Yeah, I know.

00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:42.589
Since the competition was so fierce
this time,

00:23:42.589 --> 00:23:44.424
we've planned a surprise event...

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:47.461
where fans who didn't win can have...

00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.596
a brief one-minute call with Rosanna.

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:50.397
Really?

00:23:50.831 --> 00:23:53.333
You've won the one-minute call event...

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:55.836
with Rosanna.

00:23:58.405 --> 00:23:59.339
Yay!

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:08.248
We'll begin your one-minute call.

00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:09.516
Hope you make some great memories.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.520
Hi, Gi Myung.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.355
I'm so happy to talk to you.

00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:17.457
It's Rosanna.

00:24:17.457 --> 00:24:18.392
Hi.

00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:20.727
How long have you been my fan?

00:24:20.727 --> 00:24:23.463
Today marks 2,571 days.

00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:24.498
Really?

00:24:24.498 --> 00:24:25.866
What?

00:24:26.266 --> 00:24:27.935
You've been a fan since my debut.

00:24:28.569 --> 00:24:30.904
That's amazing, I'm touched.

00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:34.208
I was front row at your concert
with your first album.

00:24:35.375 --> 00:24:38.478
You pointed at the guy...

00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:40.280
with the bunny ears.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.815
That was me.

00:24:42.316 --> 00:24:45.519
My goodness, I remember that.

00:24:46.053 --> 00:24:47.688
Please release your fifth album soon.

00:24:47.688 --> 00:24:49.923
I've been waiting so long.

00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:50.891
Right.

00:24:51.592 --> 00:24:52.993
About the fifth album...

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.533
Unfortunately, your one-minute call
ends here.

00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:01.869
Wait, hello?

00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:03.637
Rosanna wasn't done talking yet.

00:25:03.637 --> 00:25:06.673
Please continue supporting Howl Coffee.

00:25:06.907 --> 00:25:08.509
Thank you for participating.

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:09.610
Have a great day.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.311
Hello? Hello...

00:25:16.183 --> 00:25:17.217
Wow.

00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:19.920
You're good at acting.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.956
Wipe that grin off your face...

00:25:22.956 --> 00:25:24.825
unless you want to die here.

00:25:24.825 --> 00:25:27.494
Death threats now?

00:25:27.494 --> 00:25:28.929
And you're supposed to be a cop?

00:25:35.335 --> 00:25:36.236
Hello?

00:25:36.236 --> 00:25:38.172
Hello? Is this Mr. Lee Gi Myung?

00:25:38.172 --> 00:25:40.307
I'm Rosanna's manager.

00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:43.110
Please don't share what I'm about to say.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.145
Or if it ends up in court,

00:25:45.145 --> 00:25:46.413
it'll be bad for both of us.

00:25:46.413 --> 00:25:48.115
Rosanna said...

00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:50.617
she wants to be in touch with you
personally.

00:25:50.617 --> 00:25:51.418
What?

00:25:52.786 --> 00:25:56.056
She wants to keep in touch with me?

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.025
Why?

00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:00.227
I want to speak with Rosanna.

00:26:00.727 --> 00:26:02.563
Actually,

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.500
she's not in the mood to take a call
at the moment.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.467
One moment, please.

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:08.302
Rosanna.

00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:10.404
Do you want to talk to Gi Myung?

00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:12.039
No.

00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:16.143
What's going on?

00:26:17.344 --> 00:26:18.278
The thing is,

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:21.582
she just found out
they canceled her fifth album.

00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:23.550
I told you not to say anything.

00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:27.688
What do you mean?

00:26:27.688 --> 00:26:30.724
The production went over budget,

00:26:31.225 --> 00:26:32.459
now we're in trouble.

00:26:34.428 --> 00:26:35.829
We had everything lined up,

00:26:36.129 --> 00:26:37.831
and now this.

00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:41.168
I've waited so long for this comeback.

00:26:41.168 --> 00:26:43.370
How can I face my fans now?

00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:47.374
Is there anything...

00:26:47.374 --> 00:26:50.410
I can do to help?

00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:51.812
No,

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:56.049
It doesn't feel right
accepting help from fans.

00:26:56.884 --> 00:26:58.619
Let me talk to Rosanna again.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:00.053
I'll try talking to her.

00:27:04.725 --> 00:27:05.759
Gi Myung.

00:27:07.094 --> 00:27:08.996
What do you mean?

00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:10.597
Well,

00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.734
I have a small startup.

00:27:13.734 --> 00:27:15.335
We recently got some investment,

00:27:15.335 --> 00:27:17.538
I've got some cash on hand.

00:27:18.605 --> 00:27:20.707
You've given me so much
through your music. Let me help you.

00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:22.776
Gi Myung.

00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:25.646
Thank you so much.

00:27:26.713 --> 00:27:28.415
How can I ever repay you?

00:27:30.284 --> 00:27:31.585
I just have one favor to ask.

00:27:32.085 --> 00:27:33.353
On the last day of the concert,

00:27:33.353 --> 00:27:36.456
you said something to us. Remember?

00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:38.525
Just do that once.

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:40.460
That's all I need.

00:27:41.995 --> 00:27:43.497
What do you mean?

00:27:45.265 --> 00:27:47.568
You know, the thing you always say
thinking of us.

00:27:47.568 --> 00:27:48.602
Your trademark.

00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:51.905
I see.

00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:55.576
That?

00:27:57.578 --> 00:28:00.013
You didn't forget it, did you?

00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:03.183
That's impossible.

00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:06.453
Are you really Rosanna?

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.888
Yes, I am.

00:28:08.322 --> 00:28:10.123
I'm Rosanna.

00:28:10.457 --> 00:28:11.925
I really am.

00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:17.698
Really?

00:28:20.968 --> 00:28:22.035
Jeez.

00:28:23.637 --> 00:28:25.172
Hey, how's it going?

00:28:25.439 --> 00:28:27.841
I've asked around,

00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:29.042
but strangely,

00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:31.378
nobody knows anything about Wei Chang Yu.

00:28:31.578 --> 00:28:32.379
Is that so?

00:28:33.347 --> 00:28:34.281
Okay then.

00:28:36.116 --> 00:28:37.417
Why are you doing this to me?

00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:40.654
What on earth are you doing?

00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:43.490
Hey.

00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:44.725
Let her be.

00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:49.029
What's your relationship with
this psycho bitch?

00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:50.731
Who are you?

00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:52.633
I'm here to deal with this bitch.

00:28:52.633 --> 00:28:53.500
Who are you?

00:28:54.835 --> 00:28:57.271
I'm just a fan.

00:28:57.271 --> 00:29:00.274
I don't know the full story,
but violence isn't...

00:29:00.274 --> 00:29:02.142
What's wrong...

00:29:02.142 --> 00:29:04.077
with collecting money someone owes?

00:29:05.646 --> 00:29:06.547
That's...

00:29:06.547 --> 00:29:08.582
Stay out of this if you don't want to die.

00:29:09.917 --> 00:29:11.218
I'm calling the police.

00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:12.219
What? The Police?

00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:15.222
Go ahead, try it.

00:29:28.869 --> 00:29:31.271
Please, stop.

00:29:33.307 --> 00:29:35.709
Who beats a woman that brutally?

00:29:35.709 --> 00:29:36.510
What?

00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:40.047
Seems like you want to pay for her.

00:29:40.881 --> 00:29:42.316
You don't know what you're getting into.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.952
I'll pay the debt.

00:29:44.952 --> 00:29:46.520
I'll give you the money.

00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:49.089
What did you just say?

00:29:49.823 --> 00:29:52.693
I'm not sure exactly how much it is,
but I'll take care of the debt.

00:29:52.693 --> 00:29:53.527
Really?

00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:55.762
Try it if you can.

00:29:56.597 --> 00:29:57.598
It's $500,000.

00:29:59.733 --> 00:30:01.935
$500,000?

00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.438
No, Gi Myung.

00:30:10.711 --> 00:30:11.778
I'll...

00:30:11.778 --> 00:30:13.046
give you the money.

00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:15.782
So please stop harassing Rosanna.

00:30:16.183 --> 00:30:17.918
Then fine, I can't argue with that.

00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:20.254
Leave it in locker 22...

00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:23.023
Seoul Station, Exit 9
before seven tonight.

00:30:24.391 --> 00:30:26.260
If you go to the police...

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.729
No, never. I won't call the police.

00:31:08.035 --> 00:31:09.536
This is the price of my mom's life.

00:31:46.473 --> 00:31:48.809
Field, just picked up the black money.

00:31:58.852 --> 00:31:59.887
All done here.

00:32:03.323 --> 00:32:05.492
(Transaction history)

00:32:05.492 --> 00:32:06.727
Damn it, it's money.

00:32:07.561 --> 00:32:09.496
- Money.
- My goodness.

00:32:09.496 --> 00:32:10.597
Hey, hang on.

00:32:10.964 --> 00:32:12.799
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.468
500,000.

00:32:14.468 --> 00:32:15.636
Is this really $500,000?

00:32:19.606 --> 00:32:22.743
What's our highest single-day sales?

00:32:22.976 --> 00:32:24.178
$1 million.

00:32:24.878 --> 00:32:27.881
What's the most anyone's ever made
in one day?

00:32:28.248 --> 00:32:29.449
$70,000?

00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:30.884
- Wasn't it $100,000?
- $100,000?

00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:33.387
Looks like Chang Yu broke that record.

00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:36.523
Wei Chang Yu just made...

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.892
a whopping $500,000 from just one client.

00:32:40.861 --> 00:32:44.064
To celebrate our new leader Wei Chang Yu,

00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:46.600
let's party hard today!

00:32:51.238 --> 00:32:52.673
Let's party.

00:33:10.357 --> 00:33:11.859
Here, drink up.

00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:22.169
Nice.

00:33:35.415 --> 00:33:37.651
Hey, tell me.

00:33:38.952 --> 00:33:41.188
What did you learn
while working for Park Gye Soon?

00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:44.391
Are you that curious...

00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:46.527
about what I learned from her?

00:33:46.793 --> 00:33:48.462
Yes, I'm dying to know.

00:33:50.464 --> 00:33:53.233
She could do anything.
I'm fucking jealous.

00:33:54.501 --> 00:33:57.204
Before she died,

00:33:57.204 --> 00:34:00.007
did she teach you how to mesmerize people?

00:34:00.908 --> 00:34:02.609
If so, I want to learn too.

00:34:04.178 --> 00:34:06.180
It's not just how to mesmerize people.

00:34:10.784 --> 00:34:15.055
This place is really different from
our previous shop.

00:34:15.622 --> 00:34:16.523
It's like...

00:34:17.658 --> 00:34:19.059
that place was in the shadows,

00:34:19.626 --> 00:34:21.161
while this one's in the light.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.865
Mr. Ma.

00:34:26.133 --> 00:34:27.901
Don't you want to come outside?

00:34:28.435 --> 00:34:30.737
You're sharp.

00:34:31.471 --> 00:34:34.107
Here's the thing. I want to do business...

00:34:34.107 --> 00:34:35.409
I can help you...

00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:39.947
go legitimate
and turn this into a real business.

00:34:48.655 --> 00:34:50.324
Man, Wei Chang Yu.

00:34:50.657 --> 00:34:52.559
What you just said is nuts.

00:34:53.193 --> 00:34:54.294
Help?

00:34:54.294 --> 00:34:55.262
You're offering to...

00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:56.263
help me?

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:02.870
I'll teach you how to charm people...

00:35:03.971 --> 00:35:05.672
like I learn from Park Gye Soon.

00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:08.141
But first,

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:11.512
promise me one thing.

00:35:14.014 --> 00:35:14.748
Promise?

00:35:15.382 --> 00:35:16.416
I'll teach you,

00:35:17.484 --> 00:35:20.053
then make sure I earn more than
what I've taught you.

00:35:22.089 --> 00:35:24.958
This is insane.

00:35:27.094 --> 00:35:28.195
You're drunk.

00:35:28.195 --> 00:35:29.930
Damn it, you think I'm drunk?

00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:35.636
Yes, I'm drunk.

00:35:37.137 --> 00:35:39.740
I'm drunk on you.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.109
I'm drunk on Wei Chang Yu.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.813
This stuff is pricey, so drink up.

00:35:46.813 --> 00:35:48.615
It's all yours, Chang Yu.

00:35:49.016 --> 00:35:50.784
I'll walk you inside.

00:35:50.784 --> 00:35:51.752
Come on.

00:35:52.352 --> 00:35:54.121
I'm the boss, and you refuse?

00:35:54.688 --> 00:35:55.989
I don't go easy on women.

00:36:08.402 --> 00:36:10.904
Come on, drink up. Keep drinking.

00:36:12.573 --> 00:36:14.908
Dude, why are you just standing there?
Dance.

00:36:14.908 --> 00:36:17.678
You're a dancing machine.

00:36:19.413 --> 00:36:21.048
Have fun. Let's party.

00:36:39.433 --> 00:36:40.701
No.

00:36:41.368 --> 00:36:42.402
You can't rest yet.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.372
Let's see.

00:36:46.273 --> 00:36:47.207
Hey.

00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:50.043
Our mascot.

00:36:52.813 --> 00:36:54.114
Hello,

00:36:54.448 --> 00:36:56.216
I'm Manager Kim Mi Yang.

00:37:07.594 --> 00:37:09.730
Who is that?

00:37:10.197 --> 00:37:11.899
You know,

00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:14.902
some horribly unlucky lady.

00:37:16.603 --> 00:37:17.571
How so?

00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:21.141
I killed her myself.

00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:42.930
Thanks for everything.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.031
I'll make good use of your voice.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.875
There goes another one.

00:37:58.812 --> 00:37:59.780
Hey.

00:38:00.147 --> 00:38:02.916
You know what's easier than...

00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:05.285
getting caught by the cops?

00:38:06.053 --> 00:38:09.022
Killing someone and making a mascot.

00:38:14.394 --> 00:38:15.963
Ta-da.

00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:19.099
Let's see.

00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:21.068
Hey.

00:38:21.902 --> 00:38:23.437
Can you see it?

00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:27.841
Do you want this?

00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:31.545
It's from that girl
who always got her nails done.

00:38:32.045 --> 00:38:32.880
What do you say?

00:38:34.114 --> 00:38:35.883
You seem really drunk.

00:38:39.586 --> 00:38:40.420
Hey.

00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:42.656
I'm giving it to you. You don't like it?

00:38:44.958 --> 00:38:46.360
Not just anyone gets it.

00:38:54.368 --> 00:38:56.136
Fine then.

00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.176
Jeez.

00:39:03.777 --> 00:39:05.279
Gosh.

00:39:31.772 --> 00:39:33.540
(Chairman)

00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:41.515
You've got a call from the chairman.

00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:45.652
Mr. Ma.

00:39:46.086 --> 00:39:47.020
What?

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:47.955
You have a call.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:50.724
Damn it.

00:40:02.236 --> 00:40:03.837
Yes, Chairman.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.508
One moment, please.

00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:11.645
Move.

00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:18.652
The ledger?

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.556
Yes, we had a good month.
You're going to love the numbers.

00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:23.557
Don't worry.

00:40:32.766 --> 00:40:34.768
(Photomoment)

00:40:45.245 --> 00:40:46.446
Let's see.

00:40:48.815 --> 00:40:50.317
Damn it.

00:40:54.054 --> 00:40:54.922
Chairman.

00:40:56.523 --> 00:40:58.125
Could you hold on a second?

00:40:58.492 --> 00:40:59.726
I'll call you right back.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.128
Thank you.

00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:05.566
Crap.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.711
(Connection failed)

00:41:17.711 --> 00:41:19.446
(Installing)

00:41:24.351 --> 00:41:25.385
Damn it.

00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:53.113
(Installing)

00:42:05.492 --> 00:42:07.027
Hey, just leave her be.

00:42:31.952 --> 00:42:32.886
First up,

00:42:32.886 --> 00:42:35.155
show me how they have
everything set up overall.

00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:39.493
(Hacked)

00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:51.905
Well, well.

00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:54.675
Look at that setup.

00:42:57.511 --> 00:42:58.812
High-end audio surveillance,

00:42:58.812 --> 00:43:00.247
that's not cheap.

00:43:05.018 --> 00:43:06.286
Chairman, so...

00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:09.122
you want me to just give up the books?

00:43:09.122 --> 00:43:11.592
Chen Yao Qing from Sunset Group
was arrested two days ago.

00:43:12.226 --> 00:43:13.660
Macau's toast.

00:43:14.461 --> 00:43:16.463
Then where will the big mainland money go?

00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.832
That's why I was assigned Singapore.

00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:20.567
You said you'd make me big...

00:43:20.567 --> 00:43:22.836
in Singapore with the junket business.

00:43:22.836 --> 00:43:24.171
Seok Gu.

00:43:24.938 --> 00:43:25.973
Yes, sir.

00:43:26.507 --> 00:43:28.809
How's the Singapore contract coming along?

00:43:29.243 --> 00:43:30.911
You mean, L. TM Agency?

00:43:31.712 --> 00:43:32.980
It's in the final stages.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.649
Once we lock funding,
we can seal the deal quickly.

00:43:36.149 --> 00:43:37.918
Trust me, I'm sure of it.

00:43:39.152 --> 00:43:40.220
Listen.

00:43:40.921 --> 00:43:43.223
I got you this far
because of that confidence.

00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:45.025
But you know what?

00:43:45.792 --> 00:43:47.094
When I say something like this,

00:43:47.094 --> 00:43:49.530
there's meaning and philosophy behind it.

00:43:50.597 --> 00:43:53.000
I'm not sure what you mean.

00:43:54.001 --> 00:43:56.703
The L. TM Agency in Singapore
is going to sign with us.

00:43:57.738 --> 00:43:59.039
Wait, Chairman.

00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:00.207
Wait.

00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:03.143
What do you mean?

00:44:03.443 --> 00:44:06.046
Just hand over the ledger and back off.

00:44:06.046 --> 00:44:07.881
I'll find you another business.

00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:09.816
How could you do that?

00:44:10.417 --> 00:44:13.754
I invested in Singapore
because of this one business.

00:44:13.754 --> 00:44:15.756
I knew the Macau market would go south,

00:44:15.756 --> 00:44:17.958
so I'd already been building a base
in Singapore.

00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:18.859
Do you...

00:44:19.893 --> 00:44:21.195
still don't know me?

00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:24.932
I wish you had half the instincts
of Park Gye Soon.

00:44:30.304 --> 00:44:32.940
Fuck, how long has Park Gye Soon
been dead?

00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:35.509
And he's still obsessing over her.

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:38.345
Kim Doo Sik, you fucking asshole!

00:44:40.447 --> 00:44:41.348
Hey,

00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:45.252
bring over the lowest performer here.

00:44:45.853 --> 00:44:47.754
The one who's been taking my money...

00:44:48.255 --> 00:44:50.324
and not making anything.

00:44:50.724 --> 00:44:51.625
Now!

00:44:55.329 --> 00:44:57.497
Fucking idiots.

00:45:03.337 --> 00:45:04.204
Hey.

00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:07.140
It's you?

00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:09.142
Hey.

00:45:11.378 --> 00:45:12.246
Damn it.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.648
How much did you make this month?

00:45:16.116 --> 00:45:17.384
$5,000.

00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:20.354
How much did you take from me?

00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:22.589
That's...

00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:23.557
You want me to tell you?

00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:26.760
Seven grand base,
plus 50 percent commission,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.229
plus I cover your food and housing.

00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:31.365
That sums up to $10,000,
you son of a bitch.

00:45:31.832 --> 00:45:32.599
Does that sound fair?

00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:36.803
Do you think this makes any sense?

00:45:36.803 --> 00:45:39.306
I'll work harder.

00:45:39.306 --> 00:45:41.808
I swear I'll raise the profits this time.

00:45:42.776 --> 00:45:44.878
Just give me one more chance.

00:45:45.879 --> 00:45:46.914
Listen.

00:45:47.714 --> 00:45:50.717
I got you this far
because of your desperation.

00:45:52.119 --> 00:45:53.020
But you know what?

00:45:53.954 --> 00:45:55.522
When I say something like this,

00:45:57.124 --> 00:45:59.693
there's meaning and philosophy behind it.

00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:02.496
You're taking my money,

00:46:04.565 --> 00:46:07.301
and this is how you pay back the favor?

00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:10.204
You're the reason...

00:46:10.904 --> 00:46:12.639
You're the reason our company...

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.975
is in such a mess, you son a bitch.

00:46:20.047 --> 00:46:21.148
Damn it.

00:46:21.882 --> 00:46:24.218
Did you just grab my leg
with those filthy hands?

00:46:24.852 --> 00:46:27.054
I can't stand this bastard.
Get rid of him.

00:46:27.321 --> 00:46:28.288
Get him out of here.

00:46:29.022 --> 00:46:30.257
and bring me his hands.

00:46:31.692 --> 00:46:32.726
Fuck off!

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.230
This is a great time to stir things up.

00:46:38.198 --> 00:46:41.201
We have to act before Chairman Kim.

00:46:42.002 --> 00:46:44.037
I'm talking about a project...

00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:46.406
that CEO Ma would find irresistible.

00:47:03.557 --> 00:47:04.591
I hit the jackpot.

00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:22.476
It's so nice out.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.648
How's your hangover?

00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:30.984
Don't ask, I feel like crap.

00:47:31.852 --> 00:47:32.920
Damn it.

00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:35.322
I could do better than him.

00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:38.158
That sly old bastard.

00:47:38.592 --> 00:47:39.626
Mr. Ma.

00:47:41.228 --> 00:47:43.931
You know exactly how to rise to the top.

00:47:47.768 --> 00:47:49.837
Do you know Jenga, the board game?

00:47:51.605 --> 00:47:53.440
You stack it high as you want,

00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:55.576
but if the foundation's weak...

00:47:56.143 --> 00:47:57.611
it all comes down.

00:47:58.545 --> 00:48:00.147
Organizations are the same.

00:48:01.181 --> 00:48:02.082
The boss needs...

00:48:03.016 --> 00:48:04.818
someone to watch his back.

00:48:06.253 --> 00:48:07.988
Otherwise, they crumble
under any pressure.

00:48:09.389 --> 00:48:10.324
That's why...

00:48:13.093 --> 00:48:14.962
I told you I'd help.

00:48:35.082 --> 00:48:38.218
I just learned
something really interesting.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.554
Guess what?

00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:53.367
This Wei Chang Yu,

00:48:53.901 --> 00:48:56.003
is this the same person as
this Wei Chang Yu here?

00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:01.275
(Kim Mi Yang)

00:49:32.639 --> 00:49:34.975
(No Mercy)

00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:37.211
Do you know Mason Dedrick?

00:49:37.778 --> 00:49:39.413
I may not know Mason personally,

00:49:39.413 --> 00:49:42.316
but I know his right-hand man well.

00:49:42.316 --> 00:49:43.350
Any update on what I asked?

00:49:43.350 --> 00:49:44.852
Word from Samhaphoe is that...

00:49:44.852 --> 00:49:47.187
Eric Choi's pulling Mason's strings.

00:49:47.521 --> 00:49:49.022
I knew he wouldn't fall for it easily.

00:49:49.356 --> 00:49:52.226
We need to lure Ma Seok Gu
to Korea quickly...

00:49:52.226 --> 00:49:53.927
so we can do anything.

00:49:53.927 --> 00:49:55.262
He's starting a new project...

00:49:55.262 --> 00:49:57.764
without my agreement?

00:49:58.365 --> 00:50:00.734
What are you doing here?

00:50:01.268 --> 00:50:02.970
You knew all about it, didn't you?

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.273
This is Kim Doo Sik's doing, isn't it?

00:50:06.273 --> 00:50:07.508
He's trying to take my stuff again!

00:50:07.975 --> 00:50:09.409
You have five hours, Eric.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.712
That's how long you have to get home
in one piece.

00:50:13.147 --> 00:50:15.147
