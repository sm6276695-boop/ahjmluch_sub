Have you ever heard the legend of Koh Khen?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.270
Legend says that besides humans,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.460
there are other beings
who look just like us,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.550
living on Koh Khen
in perfect harmony with humans,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.350
making it impossible to tell them apart.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.780
When they are on land,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.360
they are no different from ordinary people.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.460
But whenever these beings
dive beneath the ocean,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.980
their bodies transform.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.450

Look at how he moves.

We'll have to taste them to know for sure.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.950
- I'm voting for Timmy. My bro always makes amazing stuff.
- I think P'Nava has it.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.600
We'll see. Just wait and see.

Wow, this is really good today.

You've got a real shot this time.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.680

Can I just concede now?

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.259
You're exaggerating. Definitely exaggerating.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:50.700
Alright, I'll go ahead and announce it.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.990

Yeah, you have to hand it to him.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.880
It's so good. I think...

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.990
we could put this on the restaurant menu, man.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.290
- The customers would love it.
- It'll work, it'll work.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.640
I'll try suggesting it to P'Phana first.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.710
Okay.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.140
Oh, I completely forgot.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.213
Mai-ek, we have to go pick up the supplies.

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:15.386

Come on, Phi, what are you waiting for? Let's go.

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:20.300
- The boss is going to start nagging again.
- Hey, watch the bar for me.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.260
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.290
- Watch the place for a minute, okay?
- The boss is going to complain.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.773
Hey Phi, I'm going to tidy up in the kitchen.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.840
What can I get for you today?

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.610
What do people in love usually order?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.710
That would be the list
on the first page of the menu.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.532
You can choose any flavor you'd like,

00:09:45.532 --> 00:09:48.610
from sour to sweet.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.650
What about you?

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.500
What do you like?

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.760
I like sweet.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.430
I also like...

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.910
sweet.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.490
I came up with this drink
based on my own experience.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.940
The flavor represents a love
that feels like a dream,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.220
shrouded in a mist of uncertainty.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.660
It might be a bit hard to drink at first,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.350
but once you get halfway through the glass,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.990
you'll find a sweetness that cuts through.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.930
And that...

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.360
is the reward for those
who bring that love into focus.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.630
Please, try it.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.770

I can't believe how fragrant and rich the flavors are.

Everything blends perfectly.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.390
It's absolutely delicious.

00:16:07.045 --> 00:16:08.269
Why not?

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:11.888
Don't tell me you've got your eye on Nava, too.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.791
What about your girlfriend, Namhom?

00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:16.050
Nava is like my own little brother.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.633
My family raised him as a kid.

00:16:17.633 --> 00:16:18.830
Well, that's even better.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.089
Your mom won't have any problem with it.

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:23.438
But I know you too well, Ai Phu.

00:16:23.438 --> 00:16:24.950
You've never truly loved anyone.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.154
And I don't believe for a second
that you've changed.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.291
So, go and mess with someone else.

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:34.810
That's an order, and it's non-negotiable.

00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:38.197
So that's settled.

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:39.990
I've got to go, dude.

00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:50.580
Right. We only have four kinds of wine left.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.180
Three bottles of each.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.140
Is that correct?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.704
- Yes, that's right.
- Good. Okay.

00:16:56.704 --> 00:16:58.980
Is everything in order?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.040
Yes, everything is in order.
Nava and I have listed everything out.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.460
- Thanks a lot, Timmy.
- It's okay.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.290
I need to talk to Nava for a minute.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.260
Okay, Phi.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.460
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.870
That intern I told you about, he's arriving tomorrow.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.880
Can I bring him to the bar around noon?

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.300
Yeah, that's fine.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.110
Okay, thanks.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.820
P'Phana, did you need something?

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.030
I just wanted to ask you, what were you and Phu talking about earlier?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.570
What can I get for you today?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.884
What do people in love usually order?

00:17:34.884 --> 00:17:37.752
That would be the list
on the first page of the menu.

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:40.690
You can choose any flavor profile you'd like,

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.690
from sour to sweet.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.350
What about you?

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.260
What do you like?

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.580
I like sweet.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.550
I also like...

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.070
sweet.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.060
Oh, it was nothing.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.000
Khun Phurich just ordered a drink, that's all.

00:18:07.126 --> 00:18:09.370
He was hitting on you, wasn't he?

00:18:10.067 --> 00:18:11.458
I guess so.

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.939
At first, I thought he was just
another customer,

00:18:13.939 --> 00:18:15.859
so I just played along.

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:21.120
But once I knew he was your partner, I decided to stay out of it.

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:25.778
That's a relief to hear.

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:28.910
I don't want to see you get hurt in the end.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:30.600
Ai Phu is a real player.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.525
He flirts with everyone. If you can, just avoid him.

00:18:33.525 --> 00:18:37.775
Besides, I don't want to see my Nong* get his heart broken. (*little bro/sis)

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:42.762
As for Ai Phu, if he ever found out the truth, he wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.328
Okay.

00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:53.379
Alright, then get going. I'm heading out now.

00:18:53.379 --> 00:18:54.800
Okay.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.980
Stop staring at my brother.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.153
What the hell?

00:19:25.153 --> 00:19:27.510
I can't even look?

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.830
If it were anyone else, I wouldn't care.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.320
But you're way too smooth.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.401
You have no right to lecture me
about this, Phana.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:36.442
Don't compare us.

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:40.710
At least I talk to one person at a time
and date one person at a time.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.501
And when I'm with someone,
I'm with them for a long time.

00:19:43.501 --> 00:19:45.221
So what?

00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:49.190
I don't see your love life
turning out any better than mine.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.490
If someone isn't right for you,
why force it?

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.880
Hey.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.670
Did I hit a nerve?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.040
Yeah, you hit it right on the money, Phi.

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:09.517
You know, ever since this bar opened,

00:20:09.517 --> 00:20:12.548
P'Namhom has never once set foot in here, Phi.

00:20:12.548 --> 00:20:16.160
All I see him do is drink all day,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.810
get drunk, missing her.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.908
Poor you.

00:20:19.908 --> 00:20:21.260
Isn't that right?

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.840
Don't you have anything better to do, you brat,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.360
- than eavesdrop on people's conversations?
- I'm just teasing. I was just kidding!

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.960
- Just kidding.
- Mai-ek.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.530
- Yes, Phi?
- I want more liquor.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.260
Okay. The same one, Phi?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.340
Ai Phana.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.080
Is there something you want to talk about?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.730
Namhom and I haven't seen each other
in almost three months.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.410
It's not really a big deal.

00:20:57.429 --> 00:21:01.220
We're both just busy with our own lives.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.230
She's in Bangkok,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.254
and I'm here on Koh Khen.

00:21:05.254 --> 00:21:07.870
But since we haven't seen each other
for so long,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.380
I feel like she's changed.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.690
Do you think she's seeing someone else?

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.660
I don't think so.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.130
If she really was, things would be easier.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:24.790
I'd break up with her without a second thought.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.210
So what are you going to do?

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.230
Have you tried to talk things out with her?

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.499
I have.

00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:37.138
We've tried to make it work many times,

00:21:37.138 --> 00:21:39.130
but we always end up fighting.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.941
When she called this afternoon,
we had the same argument as always.

00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:47.357
It's like we're not a part
of each other's lives anymore.

00:21:47.357 --> 00:21:49.463
It feels like...

00:21:49.463 --> 00:21:53.578
we're only together... in our relationship status.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.060
I can't even give you advice on this one, man.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.170
I've never been in a relationship
like yours before.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.270
Hey.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.793
Don't worry about it on my account.

00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:16.470
I'm sure that once we see each other again,

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.372
things will get better on their own.

00:22:18.372 --> 00:22:19.736
Hey.

00:22:19.736 --> 00:22:21.430
Cheers.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.930
Well, I hope you're right.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.100
Hey, hey.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.060
Easy there.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.490
Mind your own business.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.890
[Full & a Half Koh Khen]

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.110
[Yesterday - Phana: I have something
I want to talk about.]

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.820
The bar isn't open yet.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.160
Right now, we're only serving breakfast and coffee.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.843
I'm not here for a drink. I'm here to see P'Timmy.

00:23:37.827 --> 00:23:41.178
Timmy isn't at the bar. Is there something you need?

00:23:41.178 --> 00:23:43.420
I'm supposed to start
my internship here tomorrow,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.284
and P'Timmy told me to come meet the owner first.

00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:48.760
Oh.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.570
- Hey, Ai Ping.
- Oh, P'Timmy.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.119
Sorry I'm late. It was a rough night.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:56.410
P'Phana, this is the young guy I told you about, the one interning at the bar.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.345
Yeah, I figured.

00:23:58.345 --> 00:24:01.504
He didn't give you any trouble, did he?

00:24:01.504 --> 00:24:02.935
Give me trouble?

00:24:02.935 --> 00:24:05.803
A moment ago, he looked like a lost kid
who'd just wandered in.

00:24:05.803 --> 00:24:09.490
So, what part of the business
are you interested in?

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.319
I want to learn about the bar operations.

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.760
And to be honest, the reason I came here

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.320
is to understand how a hybrid
restaurant and bar like this works.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.700
Alright, I'll have Nava and Timmy
train you on the bar side of things.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.380
- Got it, Phi.
- And when there's time,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.780
I'll teach you the operation side myself.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.550
Oh, but when the bar gets busy,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.968
you'll probably have to help serve tables.

00:24:32.968 --> 00:24:34.830
I'd be happy to.

00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:39.392
Okay, I'll leave him with you guys.

00:24:39.392 --> 00:24:41.190
- Got it, Phi.
- I've got to get back to my work.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.970
- Come on, follow me. I'll show you the bar.
- Okay.

00:26:09.587 --> 00:26:11.490
Hello?

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.350
Hello?

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.181
What's up, Phana?

00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:20.842
Yeah, I'm outside your house now. I brought your car.

00:26:20.842 --> 00:26:23.706
Hey, is my car ready already?

00:26:23.706 --> 00:26:26.850
Yep. Come on out and get your vehicle, sir.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.600
Okay, okay, I'm coming down now.

00:26:44.362 --> 00:26:45.413
Phana.

00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:46.564
Hey.

00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:49.480
- Here's your car.
-

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.037
- I checked it all over for you.
- You asshole.

00:26:52.037 --> 00:26:54.480
Not a single scratch on it.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.310
Thanks a lot.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.741
So, how was your first night
sleeping in a new place?

00:27:00.741 --> 00:27:02.192
Not bad.

00:27:02.192 --> 00:27:05.253
Switching from a condo to a house
actually feels pretty good.

00:27:05.253 --> 00:27:07.584
That's good to hear. A change of scenery is nice.

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.420
You might end up liking it.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.851
- Phana.
- Oh, Nava. What are you doing here?

00:27:13.851 --> 00:27:17.020
Auntie Pha asked me to bring Phurich
the documents you forgot.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.803
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.610
Thanks.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.280
I was thinking of driving around town today.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.790
Would you like to be my guide?

00:27:33.897 --> 00:27:36.210
I'm not available today.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.400
He took the day off.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.290
Why is he taking the day off?

00:27:42.126 --> 00:27:44.074
You don't need to know everything.

00:27:44.074 --> 00:27:46.186
He requested this day off many days ago.

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.046
But if a member of my staff
is taking time off,

00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:50.210
shouldn't I know about it?

00:27:51.792 --> 00:27:54.540
Well, I'll be going now, Phana.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.580
Ride safely.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.100
- I will. See you.
- Bye.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.590
Bye.

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:04.163
You, seriously...

00:28:04.163 --> 00:28:05.860
Right in front of me, no less.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.173
If you're just trying to play games, go play them with someone else.

00:28:09.173 --> 00:28:11.050
Not Nava.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.530
And if I'm not playing games?

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.990
Does that mean I'm allowed to pursue him?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.920
Someone like you?

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.027
You shouldn't even say things like that.

00:28:22.027 --> 00:28:24.760
Well, since I'm here,

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.309
give me a ride to the bar.

00:28:27.309 --> 00:28:30.230
Also, an intern is starting
at the bar tomorrow.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.940
He's all yours. I don't like training people.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.980
You handle it.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.692
Fine. In that case,
you can keep an eye on the customers

00:28:37.692 --> 00:28:40.250
and handle the front-of-house for me.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.460
Let's go.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.090
I'd advise you not to touch that.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.887
Forgive my rudeness.

00:30:49.887 --> 00:30:53.318
I just saw that it was beautiful, so I...

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.590
That's precisely the reason.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:31:01.905
Its beauty is what lures humans who are full of greed, time and time again.

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:04.920
What do you mean?

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.620
Never mind.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.990
Let's just say it's a personal possession of mine,
and very valuable.

00:31:13.824 --> 00:31:17.480
By the way, what kind of fish
does this scale come from?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.580
I've never seen anything like it before.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:26.270
If I told you it was a merman's scale, would you believe me?

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:30.090
I'd have to be crazy to believe that.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.020
It's good that you don't believe it.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.190
Because the more people
who believe in these things,

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.050
the more that bad things always seem to follow.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.150
You're not a tourist, are you?

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.620
No.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.330
But you're not from this island, either.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.800
I just recently decided to move here.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.149
I'm partners with a friend
in a bar we opened.

00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:56.390
I'm also looking for a place to build a resort

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.780
and planning to stay here for the long haul.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.460
There should only be two types of people
on Koh Khen:

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.670
one, the people who are originally from here,

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.480
and two, tourists.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.820
This island is no place
for newcomers to settle down.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.530
Why is that?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.710
Excuse me.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.298
Yeah, Phana?

00:32:33.298 --> 00:32:35.360
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.470
I have to go now.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.370
Again, my apologies for being rude.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.774
May I ask your name?

00:32:53.774 --> 00:32:55.650
Silp.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.290
My name is Phurich.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.030
My bar is on the main beach.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.290
It's called Full & a Half.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.230
If you ever want to get a drink, please stop by.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.531
It was nice to meet you.

00:33:08.531 --> 00:33:10.320
Likewise.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.160
I'll be on my way now.

00:34:03.325 --> 00:34:05.847
Nava, I'm outside the house.

00:34:05.847 --> 00:34:09.430
Okay, Phraphai. I'll be right out.

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:13.290
Take your time. Come out whenever you're ready.

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.770
Got it.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.140
Okay.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:22.939
Take your time getting ready. I can wait.

00:34:22.939 --> 00:34:25.047
And as for your heart,
I can wait for that, too.

00:34:25.047 --> 00:34:28.920
No matter how long it takes,
I'll wait for you, Nava.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.440
Met.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.550
You're just trying to hitch a ride
so we can go shed our toxins, aren't you?

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.610
Hey, I was just teasing you a little.
No need to get upset.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.446
Watch what you say.

00:34:38.446 --> 00:34:41.190
I don't want Nava to find out about this.

00:34:42.058 --> 00:34:43.199
To be honest,

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.560
I think everyone on this island already knows how you feel about Nava.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.180
He's the only one who still sees you
as just a kind older brother.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.511
Let me ask you seriously.

00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:54.230
Do you have any plans at all
to tell him how you feel?

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.521
You're all adults now.

00:34:55.521 --> 00:34:57.980
If you feel something for someone, just say it.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.907
Oh, hey, Met.

00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:03.640
Are you coming with us today?

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.360
My car is having some trouble, so I'm just going to hitch a ride.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.780
Nava. Should we get going?

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.020
I'm ready.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.640
Let's see.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:22.900
Lost in a daydream, huh?

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.360
What was that?

00:35:29.779 --> 00:35:31.560
Met is just talking nonsense, Nava.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.050
Come on, let's go.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:34.550
Okay.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.970
Let's go.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.482
If you're going to be like that,
you two could have just gone by yourselves.

00:35:46.482 --> 00:35:48.390
I guess I'll shed my toxins here.

00:35:52.325 --> 00:35:55.680
Hey! Phraphai, Nava, wait for me!

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.590
The weather is great today.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.050
After we shed our toxins, I'm going to swim for a bit longer.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.450
Okay.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.570
You're not in a hurry to be anywhere,
are you, Nava?

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.770
No.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.490
I'd like to swim a little longer, too.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.750
Alright, I'm heading in first.
See you down there.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.510
Okay, see you in a bit.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.740
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.840
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

00:38:02.024 --> 00:38:03.440
Hello.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.580
If you need anything, please let us know.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.900
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.900
♫ I just know that things are gonna end bad ♫

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.480

Maiek.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.460
Our bar is pretty popular, huh?

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.410
Yeah. Even though it's not the high season,

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.020
we still get a steady flow of customers.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.370
Why is that? Because of the mermaid legend?

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.732
Whoa, you know about that?

00:38:27.732 --> 00:38:29.860
All the customers talk about it.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.190
They say that on Koh Khen,
merfolk still live among humans.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.600
They have the same appearance
and live the same way we do,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.873
so no one can tell the difference.

00:38:39.873 --> 00:38:42.503
You seem to know a lot about it.

00:38:42.503 --> 00:38:44.653
On the night before a full moon,

00:38:44.653 --> 00:38:49.313
an eight-pointed star is supposed to appear
on each of their bodies.

00:38:49.313 --> 00:38:51.113
- The night before the full moon?
- That's right.

00:38:51.113 --> 00:38:52.610
Yeah.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.610
♫ Y'all been waiting, y'all been waiting for me ♫

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.740
So do you believe in it, Phu?

00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:03.933
Everyone asks me that same question.

00:39:03.933 --> 00:39:06.480
You want to know what I tell them?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.570
If someone can show me a real, live mermaid, then I'll believe them.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.800
I get it.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.050

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.470

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.780
- Hey, Maiek.
-Yes?

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.140
Close up the bar for me, will you?

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.730
I'm going to take some customers out.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.059
Okay.

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:27.930
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.192
- No problem.
- And clear my glass for me.

00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:31.095
You got it.

00:39:31.095 --> 00:39:33.380
He doesn't even clear his own glass.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.790
Hey, Nava. Are you heading back?

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.830
I can give you a ride.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:44.146
Could I just sit here for a little longer?

00:40:44.146 --> 00:40:47.690
Okay, then. I'll wait for you on the shore.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.620
Okay.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.290

How long has it been
since I've been this drunk?

00:41:46.277 --> 00:41:47.830

To be honest...
[Next Episode]

00:42:47.481 --> 00:42:49.960
they seem more like a couple
than just brothers.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.640
Let me ask you something directly.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.188
What you're doing right now...

00:42:53.188 --> 00:42:55.288

Yes.

00:42:56.916 --> 00:42:58.778
I'm hitting on you.

00:42:58.778 --> 00:43:00.510
Are you here to eat?

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.570
No.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:03.750
Someone I'm close with works here.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.650
You mean Nava?

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:07.826
If you can see a crash coming,

00:43:07.826 --> 00:43:10.270
I'd suggest you back off now.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.500
Because there's no insurance
that will cover this.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.650
By the way, have either of you

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.280
heard the rumors about humans
coming to hunt merfolk on our island?

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.010
Den, where did you hear that from?

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.180
Nava, I don't want you to trust any human,
you understand?

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.250
Ping, are you from this island?

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.640
Why do you ask? Do I not look like I'm from here?

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.261
I think...

00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:34.100
I saw something last night.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.220
It looked like a merman.

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:41.250

it looked like...

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.510
♫ Let's live in our own new world together ♫

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.250
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're together ♫

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:03.920
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.020
♫ As long as our hearts are one ♫

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.930
♫ As long as you are with me ♫

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.250
♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:15.150
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫
