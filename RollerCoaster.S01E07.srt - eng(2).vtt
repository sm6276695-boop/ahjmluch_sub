WEBVTT

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.014
I don’t think I can handle it

00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:08.213
if both of you

00:00:08.213 --> 00:00:09.014
are together again.

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:10.514
Does she love you?

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:11.514
I’ve never asked about it.

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:12.514
I’m afraid of the answer.

00:00:12.514 --> 00:00:15.014
And she’s never said that.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.014
You also know

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:18.014
your true feelings.

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:19.814
Don’t forget to let her know.

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:21.913
I’m sorry.

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.713
I don’t know what I should do.

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:25.014
No matter which one I choose,

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.014
there’ll always be one who will be disappointed.

00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:27.814
Loft,

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:29.514
please don’t be quiet.

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:35.514
I really want to talk to you.

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:36.913
Right now, the pool villas on the east

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:39.014
are now 90% complete.

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:40.514
The electricity system is being rechecked.

00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:42.514
They’ll be ready for service next week.

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.714
Well, it sounds good.

00:00:43.714 --> 00:00:45.514
So, please you recheck everything

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:47.014
for readiness.

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.014
Sure.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.014
Hi, there.

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:51.014
How are things?

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.514
The functional design is really good.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:54.014
I like everything here.

00:00:54.014 --> 00:00:57.014
Well, I’ll bring customers here for a seminar.

00:00:57.014 --> 00:00:58.714
Uh.

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:00.514
Hey! That big vase is awesome.

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:05.813
Where did you get it from?

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:07.813
From Pure.

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:09.014
Oh!

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:11.014
Again, from your beloved lady.

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:13.014
Well, your facial expression

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:18.313
is telling me you can’t overcome it, huh?

00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:19.514
Oh my gosh!

00:01:19.514 --> 00:01:20.514
How is that possible?

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.514
Is it real?

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:22.813
Really?

00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:26.514
I’ve seen only you asking to break up with others.

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:29.014
And haven’t you guys talked to each other?

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:30.514
Um.

00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:31.514
But,

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:33.514
being like this

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:34.514
might be good.

00:01:34.514 --> 00:01:35.514
Are you sure?

00:01:35.514 --> 00:01:36.014
Umm.

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:38.014
Are you doing good?

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:41.014
I don’t believe you.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:45.813
Before I could finish speaking.

00:01:45.813 --> 00:01:48.014
Are you alright?

00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:49.514
Are you okay?

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:50.014
Yes, I am.

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:51.014
I don’t think so.

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:52.014
So pale like this.

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:53.514
Do you eat enough?

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.514
Yes.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.514
Go take a rest!

00:01:57.514 --> 00:01:58.514
You keep saying you’re okay,

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:00.514
but your physical body says no.

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:03.014
Alright, I’m taking a rest now, Mom.

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:05.014
You must.

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:06.514
Well, Ploy!

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:09.514
Please supervise the tasks here also.

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:11.014
And …

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.514
Please tell Sis. Orn

00:02:13.514 --> 00:02:15.014
if Pure calls,

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:17.814
tell her I’m not in.

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.014
Okay.

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:19.713
Thank you.
What?!

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:20.514
Why?!

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:22.014
What happened?

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:22.814
Tell me now.

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:25.514
Share me what’s happened.

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:10.814
If she’s been making you

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:12.514
this much indecisive,

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:16.014
what’s else can it be, huh?

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:18.814
I haven’t been able to reach her for a week.

00:03:18.814 --> 00:03:20.014
Umm.

00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:22.514
Or…

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:24.514
she’s dated someone else?

00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:26.014
Not too fast, huh?

00:03:26.014 --> 00:03:27.014
What?!

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:28.814
When you guys had an instant spark into each other,

00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:30.514
it didn’t take so long.

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:33.014
Umm.

00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:34.014
Hey, Pure!

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.014
You’ve never been like this before.

00:03:36.014 --> 00:03:38.814
You’ve never let yourself dive deep down like this.

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:40.514
Is she that special?

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:41.014
Umm.

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:43.014
What do you mean?

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.014
She’s all good.

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:45.514
And …

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:49.514
have you been feeling happier?

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:53.014
As she makes me happier than I used to be,

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.014
things

00:03:55.014 --> 00:03:57.014
have been so big like this.

00:03:57.014 --> 00:04:00.514
She hasn’t contacted you for a week like this.

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:02.514
What will you do after this?

00:04:02.514 --> 00:04:04.014
Or shall you try being abnormal?

00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:05.514
You don’t choose

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:07.014
but look for a new one to replace.

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.014
Well, it sounds good to me.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.514
Or will you return to Air?

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:13.014
Are you nuts?

00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:15.514
I’ve hurt her that hard.

00:04:15.514 --> 00:04:17.514
If we came back,

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:19.514
how could she trust me?

00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:21.514
Aw!

00:04:21.514 --> 00:04:22.514
I think

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:24.014
you’d better stop blaming yourself

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.014
about Air.

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:27.514
The fact is that

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:28.514
you are

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:30.014
in love with the new one

00:04:30.014 --> 00:04:32.014
after breaking up with Air.

00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:34.014
Logically speaking,

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:35.014
I think

00:04:35.014 --> 00:04:38.014
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:40.514
No. It can be wrong

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:43.514
if you know who that person is.

00:04:43.514 --> 00:04:46.014
You might be changing your thoughts.

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:51.014
What do you mean?

00:04:51.014 --> 00:04:52.014
Hah?

00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:54.014
Loft’s dating you

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:57.014
who is her sister-in-law ex-girlfriend, really?

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:58.514
Air!?

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:01.514
Umm.

00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:02.514
Umm.

00:05:02.514 --> 00:05:06.014
Maybe, it might be fine.

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.514
Well,

00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:09.014
it might be sound,

00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:12.014
but it’s not 100% correct. You know?

00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:14.514
What about Air? Does she know this?

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.014
No, she hasn’t known it yet.

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:18.014
She shouldn’t know it either.

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:19.014
OMG!

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:20.014
And …

00:05:20.014 --> 00:05:22.014
when you were dating each other

00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:24.014
everything seemed good without something off, really?

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.514
No, I knew there was something wrong.

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:28.014
But when I was with her,

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:31.014
I forget everything.

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:32.014
Maybe,

00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:33.514
the uncomfortable feeling you’re having

00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:34.514
might be a punishment

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:36.514
that you’ve to be responsible for.

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.014
Frankly speaking,

00:05:39.014 --> 00:05:41.514
though you broke up with Air,

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.014
you’ve

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:44.014
never left Air at all.

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:49.014
So, she might think you’re always the same.

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:50.014
Hey!

00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:52.514
But do not live with this feeling too long.

00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:55.014
You can be happy.

00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:56.514
I agree.

00:05:56.514 --> 00:05:57.014
All humans

00:05:57.014 --> 00:05:59.014
are selfish.

00:05:59.014 --> 00:06:01.014
But are you sure that

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:03.014
Loft really

00:06:03.014 --> 00:06:06.514
love you?

00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:13.014
So, if it’s like this,

00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:14.514
you might know

00:06:14.514 --> 00:06:17.014
what you want to do after this.

00:06:17.014 --> 00:06:18.014
If you’ve chosen,

00:06:18.014 --> 00:06:27.014
just go for it!

00:06:34.514 --> 00:06:37.514
Hello. Vela Villa.

00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:38.014
Hello.

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:40.514
Can I talk to Loft?

00:06:40.514 --> 00:06:42.014
Who’s calling, please?

00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:43.014
It’s Pure.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:44.514
I’m sorry.

00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:48.514
Well, she isn’t in now.

00:06:48.514 --> 00:06:49.514
Well, …

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:51.014
if she’s back,

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:53.014
please tell her I’ve called.

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:55.014
Of course.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:58.014
Thank you.

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:52.514
You’re welcome.

00:08:22.514 --> 00:08:28.514
Are you stressed?

00:08:28.514 --> 00:08:31.014
Is it that obvious?

00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:32.014
Umm.

00:08:32.014 --> 00:08:35.514
Ordering the bottle of wine for yourself like this,

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:38.014
you aren’t doing good, right?

00:08:38.014 --> 00:08:42.514
What’s it about?

00:08:42.514 --> 00:08:44.014
It’s none of your business, surely.

00:08:44.014 --> 00:08:45.014
Oops!

00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:48.514
So mean!

00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.014
What about this?

00:08:50.014 --> 00:08:52.514
Let’s find out whose problem is worse.

00:08:52.514 --> 00:08:55.514
Who’s having a more f**k up life,

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:57.514
is a winner.

00:08:57.514 --> 00:09:01.014
The loser

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:07.014
must foot the bill.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:08.514
Well,

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:10.514
when entering the program, I was

00:09:10.514 --> 00:09:12.514
the top scorer.

00:09:12.514 --> 00:09:13.514
But recently,

00:09:13.514 --> 00:09:16.014
after the midterm exam,

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:20.014
I got the lowest score in class.

00:09:20.014 --> 00:09:21.514
It’s not only about embarrassment,

00:09:21.514 --> 00:09:24.014
but also, it’s about my foolishness

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:28.014
that I messed up with the answer sheet myself.

00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:30.514
Every time I shared this with someone,

00:09:30.514 --> 00:09:34.014
no one believed me.

00:09:34.014 --> 00:09:36.514
Well, I’m stressed

00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:39.014
because I don’t know

00:09:39.014 --> 00:09:40.514
how to tell my mom

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:44.014
about her seriously silly daughter.

00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:48.014
Am I silly?

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:50.014
It’s your turn now.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:53.014
Mine?

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:55.014
Umm.

00:10:02.014 --> 00:10:05.014
Well, it’s just

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:07.014
that my mom has forced me

00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:11.014
to work for my dad’s company.

00:10:11.014 --> 00:10:14.014
More than that, she asked me to study for a master’s degree.

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:15.514
And you know what?

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.014
Not a degree in Thailand

00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:19.014
but in UK.

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:22.014
She wants to see me with a high profile.

00:10:22.014 --> 00:10:23.514
Huh.

00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:26.514
The worst thing is

00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:31.014
she’s holding an arranged marriage for me.

00:10:33.514 --> 00:10:35.014
My life

00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:37.014
is like a puppet show

00:10:37.014 --> 00:10:39.014
that’s always controlled and directed.

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.514
Huh.

00:10:42.514 --> 00:10:47.514
I don’t even know who truly I am now.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:50.514
Umm.

00:10:50.514 --> 00:10:52.014
Well, I guess

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:57.014
I’m lost.

00:10:57.014 --> 00:10:58.514
No need to do that.

00:10:58.514 --> 00:11:02.014
It’s okay.

00:11:02.014 --> 00:11:04.514
For all, please.

00:11:04.514 --> 00:11:06.514
I’m sorry.

00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:09.014
So am I.

00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:13.514
It’s just like sharing with someone.

00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:17.014
Well,

00:11:17.014 --> 00:11:22.014
what do you really want to do.

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:23.014
Me?

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:25.514
Umm.

00:11:32.514 --> 00:11:35.514
I want to take a break,

00:11:35.514 --> 00:11:38.514
to travel,

00:11:38.514 --> 00:11:39.514
to enjoy art

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:42.514
at various places.

00:11:42.514 --> 00:11:44.514
I want to own a small gallery

00:11:44.514 --> 00:11:47.014
where artists can come display their artworks.

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:50.014
And I can also enjoy those pieces.

00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:52.514
Hey, you know?

00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:56.514
We can be partners.

00:11:56.514 --> 00:11:58.514
I’m studying Fine Art.

00:11:58.514 --> 00:12:02.014
I’m really into sculpture.

00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:03.014
And …

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:05.014
I want to have my own studio too.

00:12:05.014 --> 00:12:08.514
But the big one.

00:12:08.514 --> 00:12:12.514
Really.

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.014
Uh.

00:12:14.014 --> 00:12:16.014
Let’s do it.

00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:18.514
Could you also show me how to work on sculpture?

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:20.514
Sure!

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:22.514
But I forgot something.

00:12:22.514 --> 00:12:26.014
My name is Pure.

00:12:26.014 --> 00:12:29.514
You can call me Air.

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:31.014
Oops!

00:12:31.014 --> 00:12:32.014
So,

00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:35.014
when we’re together,

00:12:35.014 --> 00:12:37.014
it becomes Pure & Air.

00:12:37.014 --> 00:12:43.514
It’s pure air, then.

00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:46.014
There, you’re smiling now.

00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:47.514
You know what?

00:12:47.514 --> 00:12:50.514
You look gorgeous,

00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:55.014
when smiling.

00:12:55.014 --> 00:12:57.014
So are you.

00:12:57.014 --> 00:12:58.514
Sure, with the free drinks.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.514
Shall we … cheers?

00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:04.514
Sure.

00:13:14.514 --> 00:13:17.014
Nice meeting you,

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:20.514
Air.

00:13:20.514 --> 00:13:22.014
Same here.

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:24.014
Pure,

00:13:24.014 --> 00:13:26.014
the artist

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.014
who’s accidentally failed the exam.

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:31.014
Hey!

00:13:31.014 --> 00:13:33.514
What?!

00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:53.413
You’re driving to Petchaburi.

00:15:53.413 --> 00:15:54.614
Right now?

00:15:54.614 --> 00:15:55.514
Yes.

00:15:55.514 --> 00:15:57.214
I don’t know.

00:15:57.214 --> 00:15:59.014
I only know that

00:15:59.014 --> 00:16:01.214
this time I’m not going to wait for anything.

00:16:22.035 --> 00:16:23.334
Hello. Vela Villa.

00:16:23.334 --> 00:16:24.234
Hello.

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.635
Is Loft back?

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:28.435
Oh! Hello.

00:16:28.435 --> 00:16:30.135
Well, she is …

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.834
Isn’t she in?

00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.834
Well, I’ve tried reaching her at the Bangkok house.

00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:36.534
She’s not there either.

00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:40.034
I’m really worried about her.

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:44.934
Can you ask her to talk to me, please?

00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.135
Loft! Loft!

00:16:46.135 --> 00:16:46.934
What?!

00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:50.835
How long are you staying here?

00:16:50.835 --> 00:16:52.135
Well, quite a while.

00:16:52.135 --> 00:16:52.934
What’s wrong?

00:16:52.934 --> 00:16:54.934
Are you staying here longer, huh?

00:16:54.934 --> 00:16:56.135
I just wanted to know.

00:16:56.135 --> 00:17:00.635
Well. Alright.

00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:02.434
Thank you.

00:17:02.434 --> 00:17:05.534
Oh. You’re welcome.

00:17:05.534 --> 00:17:11.635
This is what we can only do, you know?

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:16.635
What?!

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:17.535
Are you serious?

00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:19.635
You’re driving to Petchaburi.

00:17:19.635 --> 00:17:22.135
Right now?

00:17:22.135 --> 00:17:23.934
What if she’s already had someone else?

00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:26.135
What are you going to do?

00:17:26.135 --> 00:17:28.635
Well, I don’t know.

00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:30.635
But I just know that

00:17:30.635 --> 00:17:33.635
this time I’m not going to wait for anything.

00:17:47.035 --> 00:17:47.635
Nah.

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:50.934
Oh no!!!

00:17:50.934 --> 00:17:53.434
Are you going to get me drunk?

00:17:53.434 --> 00:17:56.234
The previous bottle, you just sipped it very little.

00:17:56.234 --> 00:17:59.335
I don’t like it when I wake up with the hangover feeling.

00:17:59.335 --> 00:18:01.934
They should produce non-hangover wines.

00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:03.635
If so, I’ll drink it every day.

00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:04.934
Umm.

00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:06.335
There might be,

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.635
but we don’t know.

00:18:08.635 --> 00:18:11.035
What about

00:18:11.035 --> 00:18:13.234
Soju, Sake

00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:14.234
Voda,

00:18:14.234 --> 00:18:15.635
or rice whisky?

00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:17.635
They might be fine with you.

00:18:17.635 --> 00:18:19.434
I’ve tried all of them.

00:18:19.434 --> 00:18:21.234
None.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:23.135
If not, no drinking.

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:26.834
Just quit as you told me before.

00:18:26.834 --> 00:18:30.035
Well, actually I shouldn’t drink too much.

00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:32.234
I’ve to take good care of my health.

00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:34.334
Huh?

00:18:34.334 --> 00:18:37.834
My partner and I are planning to have a kid.

00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:39.435
Really?

00:18:39.435 --> 00:18:40.935
Congratulations!

00:18:40.935 --> 00:18:42.535
Not yet. Please wait.

00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:44.535
I’m afraid it’s too early.

00:18:44.535 --> 00:18:45.334
Wait for that day!

00:18:45.334 --> 00:18:47.535
Please say Congrats again later.

00:18:47.535 --> 00:18:49.935
Alright.

00:18:49.935 --> 00:18:51.035
Umm.

00:18:51.035 --> 00:18:54.635
What about you? Do you want to have a kid?

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.935
Before I hadn’t thought about it,

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.834
until Aim, my friend once told me

00:18:58.834 --> 00:19:01.234
that we might not want a kid

00:19:01.234 --> 00:19:03.234
until

00:19:03.234 --> 00:19:05.834
we met someone we loved so much

00:19:05.834 --> 00:19:08.834
that we wanted to see our half and the other half

00:19:08.834 --> 00:19:13.334
developed.

00:19:13.334 --> 00:19:15.535
She’s right.

00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:19.834
Well, have you found that person yet?

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:22.635
Already.

00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:26.635
But it’s impossible.

00:19:26.635 --> 00:19:28.834
Well, I’ll stop asking about it.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.834
So, I’ll let you

00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:32.834
congratulate me on something else instead.

00:19:32.834 --> 00:19:36.435
What shall it be about?

00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:38.135
Umm.

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.935
Then what about congratulating on …

00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:41.635
our no drinking campaign.

00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:44.035
Is that good?

00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:46.435
But can mine be water?

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.635
Are you sure?

00:19:48.635 --> 00:19:50.135
But that’s fine.

00:19:50.135 --> 00:19:53.935
Cheers!

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:54.635
Easy girl!

00:19:54.635 --> 00:19:56.635
There it is.

00:19:56.635 --> 00:19:58.135
Oh no!

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.234
Jeez!

00:19:59.234 --> 00:20:00.135
Umm.

00:20:00.135 --> 00:20:01.334
I’m sorry.

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:03.334
I didn’t mean to let this happen.

00:20:03.334 --> 00:20:03.935
Oh no!

00:20:03.935 --> 00:20:05.334
Go wash it in the toilet.

00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:06.035
I’ll take care of the things here.

00:20:06.035 --> 00:20:07.135
Alright. You can go.

00:20:07.135 --> 00:20:07.935
So messy now.

00:20:07.935 --> 00:20:09.635
Aw!

00:20:17.435 --> 00:20:23.234
Oh!

00:20:23.234 --> 00:20:26.334
Such a terrible stain!

00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:27.135
Give me your top.

00:20:27.135 --> 00:20:29.935
I’ll wash it.

00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:31.534
What?!

00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:32.935
It’s okay.

00:20:32.935 --> 00:20:34.935
You don’t have to.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.334
Are you shy?

00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:37.534
You’d better not be shy, with this terribly spilled top.

00:20:37.534 --> 00:20:40.635
And you’ll have to walk back to the office for a while.

00:20:45.135 --> 00:20:45.935
Here it is.

00:20:45.935 --> 00:20:48.435
Put this shirt on first.

00:20:48.435 --> 00:20:49.834
Thank you.

00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:57.135
You’re the kindest boss.

00:20:57.135 --> 00:20:57.935
Oh!

00:20:57.935 --> 00:21:00.435
Sorry!

00:21:12.935 --> 00:21:15.034
I’m done.

00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:18.135
Oh!

00:21:18.135 --> 00:21:22.135
Okay.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:24.635
Your top!

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:25.534
Pure!

00:21:32.135 --> 00:21:32.935
Hey!

00:21:32.935 --> 00:21:33.635
Excuse me.

00:21:33.635 --> 00:21:35.034
Hey! I’m alright.

00:21:35.034 --> 00:21:36.235
Pure!

00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:37.635
Pure!

00:22:07.334 --> 00:22:11.435
Call Pure!

00:23:00.034 --> 00:23:01.135
Well,

00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:03.834
Ploy’s a new secretary of mine.

00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:07.635
I just asked her to talk with me.

00:23:07.635 --> 00:23:12.635
There’s nothing complicated.

00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:15.635
Well, it sounds like I’m trying to make things up.

00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:19.235
But it’s the fact.

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:23.034
Why have you been avoiding me?

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:28.834
You want to leave me forever, huh?

00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:30.235
If I’ve to admit

00:23:30.235 --> 00:23:32.735
that I’m losing you,

00:23:32.735 --> 00:23:36.834
I can’t.

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:42.135
Neither can I.

00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:46.834
I’ve to thank the secretary.

00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:50.635
As when I saw you and her together,

00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.834
it made me know

00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:56.235
how my true feeling.

00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:59.635
If I hadn’t felt anything,

00:23:59.635 --> 00:24:01.635
I would have gone back to Bangkok already.

00:24:04.034 --> 00:24:09.635
So, you came here instead, huh?

00:24:09.635 --> 00:24:12.935
Loft,

00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:15.334
between Air and I

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:17.635
it’s over.

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:22.834
You’re saying that

00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:24.635
I’ve been chosen, right?

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:35.034
It’s not only that I’ve chosen you,

00:24:35.034 --> 00:24:37.635
but it’s also you

00:24:37.635 --> 00:24:39.635
who always choose me.

00:24:44.034 --> 00:24:45.335
You also know

00:24:45.335 --> 00:24:49.235
how I feel about you.

00:24:49.235 --> 00:24:51.635
Yes.

00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:54.635
What I’ve done

00:24:54.635 --> 00:24:58.635
might hurt you so much

00:24:58.635 --> 00:25:00.635
that you might avoid me.

00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:12.635
Loving you

00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:14.335
hurts me

00:25:14.335 --> 00:25:16.635
the most.

00:25:16.635 --> 00:25:18.635
It’s real painful.

00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:29.235
But I’ll choose

00:25:29.235 --> 00:25:33.635
what doesn’t hurt me later too.

00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:07.534
Am I right here in time?

00:26:07.534 --> 00:26:10.635
If it was later, it would be no problem too.

00:26:18.135 --> 00:26:22.335
Let’s go home.

00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:23.434
Are you alright?

00:26:23.434 --> 00:26:24.635
Umm.

00:26:37.635 --> 00:26:38.835
It’s like a dream

00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:42.635
that you’re here with me.

00:26:42.635 --> 00:26:44.534
I’m trying to make

00:26:44.534 --> 00:26:49.034
our story better.

00:26:49.034 --> 00:26:52.135
But I’m serious about our relationship.

00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:54.034
After this,

00:26:54.034 --> 00:26:58.934
what’s our relationship like?

00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:04.835
We’re lovers.

00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:05.635
Oops!

00:27:05.635 --> 00:27:08.235
Like a dream, really.

00:27:08.235 --> 00:27:09.835
Ooh!

00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:11.235
Do you believe

00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:13.635
it’s not a dream anymore?

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:19.335
Don’t expect too much.

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:21.635
I’m a normal person

00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:23.635
that can’t be

00:27:23.635 --> 00:27:27.434
your 24-hour happiness.

00:27:27.434 --> 00:27:28.635
I know

00:27:28.635 --> 00:27:30.934
that you’re a normal one

00:27:30.934 --> 00:27:33.335
but you’re special to me as I love you.

00:27:33.335 --> 00:27:34.635
That’s enough for me.

00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:35.635
Umm.

00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:36.635
Umm.

00:27:36.635 --> 00:27:38.135
Oops!

00:27:38.135 --> 00:27:39.635
It seems like a dream again.

00:27:39.635 --> 00:27:40.635
Oh!

00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:42.135
Still like being in a dream?

00:27:42.135 --> 00:27:44.434
This hurts.

00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:47.335
Are you teasing me?

00:27:47.335 --> 00:27:48.434
My love.

00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:50.034
My love.

00:27:50.034 --> 00:27:50.835
What?!

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:51.635
My love.

00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:53.934
I’ll keep calling you like this.

00:27:53.934 --> 00:27:55.835
New toy hype, huh?

00:27:55.835 --> 00:27:56.635
Sure.

00:27:56.635 --> 00:27:58.635
It’s taken me so long to have this day.

00:28:27.135 --> 00:28:34.135
I love you.

00:28:34.135 --> 00:28:36.934
I also …

00:28:36.934 --> 00:28:40.135
I want to hear it too.

00:28:40.135 --> 00:28:42.135
If you’re not ready,

00:28:42.135 --> 00:28:44.835
it can be later.

00:28:44.835 --> 00:28:49.335
I can wait.

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:52.934
I promise

00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:55.635
that I won’t hurt you.

00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:42.835
Thank you, Lamp.

00:29:42.835 --> 00:29:46.434
What’s wrong with you, Air?

00:30:17.096 --> 00:30:19.296
Oh! Please don’t stare at me.

00:30:19.296 --> 00:30:21.496
I can’t focus on anything now.

00:30:21.496 --> 00:30:24.496
You can continue coloring it without overthinking.

00:30:24.496 --> 00:30:27.296
I just wanted to look at you.

00:30:27.296 --> 00:30:32.196
It’s like I’m being inspected all the time.

00:30:32.196 --> 00:30:33.496
Hey!

00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:37.496
When can you stop having negative feelings toward art teachers, huh?

00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:39.496
I’m not a teacher.

00:30:39.496 --> 00:30:43.295
But your lover.

00:30:43.295 --> 00:30:46.096
I like it when you say things like this.

00:30:46.096 --> 00:30:47.496
Well.

00:30:47.496 --> 00:30:48.696
Please keep staring at me.

00:30:48.696 --> 00:30:52.996
I’m pleased to continue now.

00:30:52.996 --> 00:30:55.496
Uh.

00:30:55.496 --> 00:30:57.295
Finished!

00:30:57.295 --> 00:31:01.496
Well, can I have a look?

00:31:01.496 --> 00:31:03.996
Ba-dum!

00:31:06.496 --> 00:31:08.496
Ah.

00:31:08.496 --> 00:31:09.496
Oh!

00:31:09.496 --> 00:31:11.496
Well,

00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:14.996
I’m not an artist.

00:31:14.996 --> 00:31:17.496
It’s good enough for me.

00:31:17.496 --> 00:31:20.295
But I attentively worked on this.

00:31:31.496 --> 00:31:37.996
This is a reward for your good attempt.

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:38.996
Huh.

00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:41.496
Looking at me like this,

00:31:41.496 --> 00:31:45.496
haven’t you been kissed before?

00:31:45.496 --> 00:31:47.496
You know it well.

00:31:47.496 --> 00:31:48.996
But,

00:31:48.996 --> 00:31:52.996
it was quite exciting.

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:55.496
You really enjoy

00:31:55.496 --> 00:32:00.496
excitement, huh?

00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:01.496
Umm.

00:32:01.496 --> 00:32:03.496
Can I ask you something?

00:32:03.496 --> 00:32:05.996
Huh?

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:08.496
With Air,

00:32:08.496 --> 00:32:09.996
how was the ending like?

00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:22.496
Apologies.

00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:25.996
Crying.

00:32:25.996 --> 00:32:28.496
Telling her it can’t be the same.

00:32:33.496 --> 00:32:36.496
If it wasn’t Air,

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.496
how would our story be?

00:32:47.496 --> 00:32:49.996
Talking about Air,

00:32:49.996 --> 00:32:54.496
she treats everything easily for the sake of others

00:32:54.496 --> 00:32:55.996
while her matters are

00:32:55.996 --> 00:32:58.496
always difficult.

00:32:58.496 --> 00:33:01.496
Because she loves you.

00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:09.996
Pure,

00:33:09.996 --> 00:33:11.496
are you okay?

00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:19.496
Well,

00:33:19.496 --> 00:33:25.496
Air hasn’t known about us.

00:33:25.496 --> 00:33:27.496
So,

00:33:27.496 --> 00:33:30.496
are you telling her soon?

00:33:34.496 --> 00:33:37.496
Or you can let me do so.

00:33:37.496 --> 00:33:39.496
I feel guilty.

00:33:39.496 --> 00:33:43.996
I don’t want to have you secretly.

00:33:43.996 --> 00:33:45.496
How?

00:33:45.496 --> 00:33:50.496
One day, she’s going to know it.

00:33:50.496 --> 00:33:53.496
I want to tell her myself.

00:33:53.496 --> 00:33:55.496
Let me have more time.

00:34:18.496 --> 00:34:19.496
Lamp,

00:34:19.496 --> 00:34:22.496
this is actually too much for me.

00:34:22.496 --> 00:34:24.496
Though we divorced,

00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:27.996
this place is still yours.

00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:29.496
It’s okay.

00:34:29.496 --> 00:34:30.996
I gave it to you

00:34:30.996 --> 00:34:33.496
as a present

00:34:33.496 --> 00:34:35.496
for your freedom.

00:34:35.496 --> 00:34:36.996
Lamp.

00:35:02.496 --> 00:35:05.496
Do you know

00:35:05.496 --> 00:35:07.496
that I’ve never been sad

00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:10.996
once marrying you.

00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.996
But it was really my pleasure

00:35:12.996 --> 00:35:15.496
living with you.

00:35:19.496 --> 00:35:21.496
Thank you, Lamp.

00:35:30.496 --> 00:35:32.496
What’s wrong with you, Air?

00:35:32.496 --> 00:35:34.496
What happened?

00:35:34.496 --> 00:35:35.496
Don’t tell me that

00:35:35.496 --> 00:35:38.996
your mom is still upset.

00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:39.996
Being upset

00:35:39.996 --> 00:35:42.496
is part of her life now.

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:43.496
She can’t do anything

00:35:43.496 --> 00:35:47.496
because it’s you who asked me to divorce.

00:35:47.496 --> 00:35:48.496
Well,

00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:50.496
why do you look

00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:54.996
quite sad?

00:35:54.996 --> 00:35:56.996
Heartbroken.

00:35:56.996 --> 00:35:58.496
Heartbroken?

00:35:58.496 --> 00:36:00.996
From Pure?

00:36:00.996 --> 00:36:02.496
Yes.

00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:06.996
She’s had someone else already.

00:36:06.996 --> 00:36:07.996
Well,

00:36:07.996 --> 00:36:12.996
do you know that person?

00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.996
It’s not that important.

00:36:14.996 --> 00:36:20.996
I couldn’t make it in time, and that’s the point.

00:36:20.996 --> 00:36:23.496
Air,

00:36:23.496 --> 00:36:27.996
I’m sorry for the delay.

00:36:27.996 --> 00:36:29.996
It’s okay, Lamp.

00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:31.996
You don’t have to blame yourself.

00:36:31.996 --> 00:36:33.496
Actually,

00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:35.496
I’d thought before that it was going to

00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:39.996
turn out like this.

00:36:39.996 --> 00:36:40.996
Err.

00:36:40.996 --> 00:36:43.496
In fact,

00:36:43.496 --> 00:36:46.996
you can continue working at the company if you want.

00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:47.996
I don’t think so.

00:36:47.996 --> 00:36:49.996
I also have my dignity.

00:36:49.996 --> 00:36:51.996
Your family’s agreed to provide my mom salary

00:36:51.996 --> 00:36:53.996
from being a board committee.

00:36:53.996 --> 00:36:58.496
I’m really thankful.

00:36:58.496 --> 00:37:01.496
Well,

00:37:01.496 --> 00:37:06.996
what’s next after this?

00:37:06.996 --> 00:37:08.496
Well,

00:37:08.496 --> 00:37:12.496
a friend of mine is opening a restaurant in France

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:13.496
next month.

00:37:13.496 --> 00:37:15.496
I want to help her there.

00:37:15.496 --> 00:37:17.496
I’m looking for a permanent job too.

00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:19.496
If I can find a good job,

00:37:19.496 --> 00:37:22.996
I’ll live there as long as I can.

00:37:22.996 --> 00:37:24.496
A long term?

00:37:24.496 --> 00:37:24.996
So,

00:37:24.996 --> 00:37:29.496
aren’t you going to come back to Thailand?

00:37:29.496 --> 00:37:34.496
I don’t have anyone here.

00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:37.496
I want to restart my life

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:40.496
by myself.

00:37:40.496 --> 00:37:42.996
I want my mom to see that

00:37:42.996 --> 00:37:49.496
I can live without bothering others.

00:37:49.496 --> 00:37:51.496
Well,

00:37:51.496 --> 00:37:54.496
before you go

00:37:54.496 --> 00:37:56.496
you’d better tell Loft

00:37:56.496 --> 00:37:59.496
you’re leaving soon.

00:37:59.496 --> 00:38:00.996
I think

00:38:00.996 --> 00:38:03.496
Loft might want to see you face to face.

00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:13.496
Air’s going to France.

00:38:13.496 --> 00:38:15.996
If I don’t talk to her now,

00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:18.996
things are getting worse.

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:19.996
France?

00:38:31.196 --> 00:38:33.397
I understand.

00:38:33.397 --> 00:38:35.197
If you’ve made up your mind,

00:38:35.197 --> 00:38:37.596
Congratulations!

00:38:37.596 --> 00:38:40.096
Well, I have something to talk to you.

00:38:40.096 --> 00:38:41.796
Really?

00:38:41.796 --> 00:38:42.796
So,

00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:44.096
if I go see you in Petchaburi,

00:38:44.096 --> 00:38:46.296
is there an available room for me?

00:38:46.296 --> 00:38:48.197
Sure.

00:38:48.197 --> 00:38:50.697
When is it?

00:38:50.697 --> 00:38:51.296
What about tomorrow?

00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:52.997
Is it too early?

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:53.697
If it’s too early,

00:38:53.697 --> 00:38:57.096
let me revise my plan later.

00:38:57.096 --> 00:38:57.997
Well,

00:38:57.997 --> 00:38:59.597
tomorrow is okay.

00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:02.397
I’ll ask a maid to prepare a room for you.

00:39:02.397 --> 00:39:02.795
Alright.

00:39:02.796 --> 00:39:04.997
See you tomorrow.

00:39:04.997 --> 00:39:07.997
Well, Air.

00:39:07.997 --> 00:39:11.696
Huh? Go ahead!

00:39:11.696 --> 00:39:13.196
Err. Nothing.

00:39:13.196 --> 00:39:15.796
I’ll wait until we meet.

00:39:15.796 --> 00:39:17.397
Okay. Alright.

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:19.297
See you.

00:39:35.696 --> 00:39:37.196
I told you

00:39:37.196 --> 00:39:40.996
I’m going to talk to Air soon.

00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:42.397
I’m sorry

00:39:42.397 --> 00:39:45.897
that I didn’t ask for your opinion.

00:39:45.897 --> 00:39:49.797
Air’s going to France soon.

00:39:49.797 --> 00:39:50.397
I’m afraid that

00:39:50.397 --> 00:39:51.797
if I don’t tell Air now,

00:39:51.797 --> 00:39:54.797
it can be worse.

00:39:54.797 --> 00:39:59.297
France?

00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:00.996
She’s arriving here tomorrow.

00:40:01.097 --> 00:40:03.397
Will you want to go back to Bangkok first?

00:40:09.696 --> 00:40:11.397
Or will you change your mind?

00:40:18.397 --> 00:40:22.897
I’ve promised

00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:26.096
not to hurt you anymore.

00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:37.897
Alright.

00:43:08.997 --> 00:43:10.796
That painting

00:43:10.796 --> 00:43:13.596
represents that person, right?

00:43:13.596 --> 00:43:14.997
Air!

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:28.796
Loft,

00:44:28.796 --> 00:44:31.997
I’m on my way.

00:45:41.997 --> 00:45:44.697
I just wanted to do the right thing.

00:45:44.697 --> 00:45:46.497
I’ve made a decision.

00:45:46.497 --> 00:45:47.596
Let’s do something

00:45:47.596 --> 00:45:50.397
we won’t regret it later.

00:45:58.997 --> 00:46:01.997
Can't it be someone else, Pure?
