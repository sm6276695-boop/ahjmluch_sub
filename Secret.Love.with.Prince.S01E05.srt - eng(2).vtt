00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.907
I want to hold you tighter.

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:20.828
Wait a minute!

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:27.411
I need just 30 seconds to take a deep breath.

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:29.804
- Denied.
- What?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.545
Just kidding.

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:42.016
I'm happy because I got you
all to myself for a while.

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.773
I'll go get us something to drink.

00:00:56.312 --> 00:00:58.039
That was so uncool.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.217
What's gotten into me?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.886
There will be hardly
any time to relax for a while.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:58.780
Lessons will start tomorrow.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.789
That's going to be exhausting.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.416
But I'm looking forward to it.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.422
Yeah.

00:02:04.422 --> 00:02:07.012
It would be nice if we could
join the sports tournament, right?

00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:09.812
- Definitely.
- When is that again?

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:11.973
Next weekend.

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.895
It's been a while since I've played basketball.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:17.734
- That's true.
- Can you even play sports?

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:19.042
You're such a slow wit.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.602
Here comes the devil!

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:23.461
I heard that Prism is going to be busy
with the publicity for a while.

00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:25.301
Yeah, that's why I came now.

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:26.927
Being an idol is intense, right?

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.028
There's just too much to do.

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:31.507
It's so different from being a dancer.

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:34.118
I really respect Terzetto for keeping it up.

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:35.627
You're so right.

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:38.368
They're shattering all our debut records.

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:40.252
The new song is released on the same day, right?

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:41.669
Give me a break.

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.074
You gotta be the best at the sports festival.

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:46.221
Am I right, brother-complex little sister?

00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.291
The sports festival has nothing to do
with brother complex.

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:56.596
The MVP prize for the sports festival is the
chance to have Terzetto all to yourself for a day.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.506
A chance to have them all to yourself?

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:04.956
Well, I guess we can't do anything.

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:08.037
- This cake is delicious.
- All to yourself?

00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:18.736
What?

00:03:20.727 --> 00:03:23.611
Hey, are you okay?

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:29.278
Matsuri, if you'd like, I could talk to
the committee and have you step down.

00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:30.744
It's okay.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:33.230
It's definitely going to be exciting!

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.057
Terzetto is just the best as always!

00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:37.933
The number one idol!

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.382
I shouldn't make a face
and be a spoilsport.

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:50.851
Pass to me!

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.726
MVP!

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:56.905
MVP!

00:03:58.984 --> 00:04:00.670
Sorry.

00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:05.550
Could you please practice more seriously?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.543
You're their sibling after all.

00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:09.470
You don't need this chance
to have them all to yourself, right?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.274
I get it. Are you laughing at us
for being so desperate?

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:15.864
No, I'm not.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.491
You are so slow-witted!

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:27.134
Sorry.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:31.341
She's a bit slow-witted,
so she couldn't catch that pass.

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:39.132
It seems like she's holding everyone back,
so let me practice with her elsewhere.

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:41.093
- Huh?
- Let's go.

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:42.282
What?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.951
You're leaving?

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.270
I'll practice with you too!

00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:52.324
Erm... thank you.

00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:59.748
I don't want to be another topic of discussion
if people see us together.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.355
See you.

00:05:05.927 --> 00:05:10.234
You know, you're really boring.

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:14.288
- Huh?
- Even though you appeared in the Prism video,

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:17.257
you're just moping around in the end.

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:19.731
You're so annoying, I can't even watch.

00:05:22.858 --> 00:05:25.853
You're just afraid of being
talked about behind your back.

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:30.771
Get it together.

00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:33.223
Are you still my toy?

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.336
I don't intend to be a toy.

00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:40.528
Are you really that shocked?

00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:44.933
Just because your beloved Azusa
spends a day with someone else?

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.047
How immature.

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:57.538
Can't you just win the MVP yourself?

00:05:58.527 --> 00:05:59.573
Huh?

00:05:59.573 --> 00:06:04.233
Instead of moping around,
why not just protect your brothers yourself?

00:06:05.728 --> 00:06:08.801
You need to do something to become worthy, right?

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:11.847
Did you forget that because you're too silly?

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:16.586
That's right!

00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:18.770
That's exactly what I'm going to do!

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.243
I'm aiming for MVP!

00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:25.074
Thanks, Yamato!

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:30.875
I didn't know you could say
something smarter other than teasing.

00:06:32.084 --> 00:06:35.782
Alright, I'm going to go all in!

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:41.185
I'm trying not to say it, but...

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:44.067
What a dummy.

00:06:50.123 --> 00:06:52.935
Sorry for calling you out of your lesson.

00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:57.292
I'll be coming home late for a while.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.154
The meals are in the fridge,
so please help yourself.

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:07.557
Are you angry about something?

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:10.509
Not really.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:13.333
I just thought you seemed
to have plenty of free time...

00:07:14.722 --> 00:07:17.192
to skip class with Yamato.

00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:20.547
I'm not really free, actually.

00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:23.020
That's why I practice.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.739
I want to win the MVP at the sports tournament.

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.791
Wait, you hated that idea, didn't you?

00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:33.911
- Then I'll go tell the committee...
- I want to fight fair and square.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.816
Azusa, just stay there as an idol.

00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:41.617
I'll reach out to you.

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:43.858
What...

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.542
When I'm not your big brother,
I'm quite popular, you know?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.631
Yeah.

00:08:16.441 --> 00:08:22.400
I really do want to do it for real, but I'll
hold back until you make a final decision on me.

00:08:38.989 --> 00:08:40.567
I'll be waiting.

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:52.599
I'm heading out.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:54.897
Oh no, I'm late!
[The new song practice is tough!]

00:08:54.897 --> 00:08:56.958
What's for today?
[My hands hurt from sports practice!]

00:08:57.606 --> 00:08:59.244
Okay.
[Do your best! You too, brothers!]

00:09:04.046 --> 00:09:05.993
A cooking show?

00:09:20.627 --> 00:09:21.867
Alright.

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.663
[Congrats! A new song release soon!
Sports tournament final push!]

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:35.634
Amamiya, sorry to bother you, but could you
put the balls away in the storage when you leave?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.762
- Sure.
- Thanks.

00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:41.573
We're leaving now.
Let's do our best tomorrow.

00:09:41.573 --> 00:09:43.816
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:09:46.078 --> 00:09:48.096
Alright.

00:09:51.796 --> 00:09:55.776
Okay! Now, it's time for the main event.

00:10:02.522 --> 00:10:05.099
This one's for being friends with Yamato.

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:08.078
I'll let you out once the game is over tomorrow.

00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:10.903
Just stay quiet, okay?

00:10:10.903 --> 00:10:13.741
Seriously, she's so dumb.

00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:16.588
Hey! Hello!

00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:19.800
Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.359
Oh no!

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:25.504
What time is it now?

00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:28.628
Oh no, I skipped class and fell asleep.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.600
Yamato! Your phone!

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.228
- Do you have your phone?
- What, what...

00:10:32.228 --> 00:10:33.569
Phone.

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.007
Sorry, did you need it?

00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:43.080
The door's locked.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.795
We can't get out.

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:48.914
Hey, is someone out there?

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:51.867
- Hello! Come on!
- Hey, you're going to hurt yourself.

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:55.145
- Let's calm down for a moment.
- I have the game!

00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:58.103
I promised to be the MVP!

00:10:58.103 --> 00:11:00.623
Someone!

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:04.054
- I understand, but...
- Let go of me already!

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.461
Huh?

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.837
Huh?

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:13.978
What?

00:11:18.653 --> 00:11:21.164
The ranking for the new song is out.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.607
We're in 2nd place.

00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:25.215
2nd place?

00:11:25.215 --> 00:11:27.212
Prism is on top.

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:31.640
Wait, are you kidding me?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.557
We're in the third year since our debut.

00:11:34.557 --> 00:11:38.596
The agency seems to be
fully supporting Prism now.

00:11:38.596 --> 00:11:41.100
Maybe it's a matter of determination.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.192
The members of Prism are putting
everything on the line, their lives and careers.

00:11:45.192 --> 00:11:47.255
Not like you guys.

00:11:48.117 --> 00:11:50.569
They've completely replaced you.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.223
Terzetto is finished.

00:11:56.015 --> 00:11:58.751
No way! Terzetto isn't done.

00:12:05.897 --> 00:12:09.917
We might not be able to
call for help until morning.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.288
Hey, are you even listening?

00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:21.961
I'm seriously thinking of a way to escape.

00:12:21.961 --> 00:12:24.238
Can you stop with the dirty thoughts?

00:12:24.238 --> 00:12:26.804
What? I'm not thinking about that!

00:12:26.804 --> 00:12:30.081
And why are you so calm?

00:12:30.081 --> 00:12:33.289
Even after the kiss...

00:12:33.289 --> 00:12:35.202
It was just an accident.

00:12:35.202 --> 00:12:39.863
Yes, it was just an accident, but still...

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:43.559
It was an accident.
That was definitely an accident.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:47.143
- Nothing more than that.
- This is getting annoying, seriously.

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:49.252
It's just a kiss, nothing more.

00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:02.547
Don't step over this line anymore.

00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:03.922
Look who's talking.

00:13:03.922 --> 00:13:06.484
- Why would I do that?
- Oh, good.

00:13:06.484 --> 00:13:11.270
You're the best as a fling, but as a lover,
you're just too childish and boring.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.997
I already know that!

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.739
Huh?

00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:28.478
Sorry, but the only thing
I really can't handle is thunder.

00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:32.547
What the...

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:35.028
He's telling us to be ready...

00:13:35.028 --> 00:13:36.409
Ready for what, exactly?

00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:46.065
I really don't want to lose to Prism.

00:13:46.065 --> 00:13:48.685
Azusa, you're really competitive.

00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:51.245
Well, it annoys me too, but...

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.099
But how do we get back on top?

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:56.726
Hey.

00:13:56.726 --> 00:13:58.559
Whoa, speak of the devil.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:00.694
I had a meeting on the floor above.

00:14:00.694 --> 00:14:04.733
What, he's not here? Where did that slacker go?

00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:06.774
Have you seen Yamato?

00:14:06.774 --> 00:14:11.061
I haven't been able to contact Matsuri
and Yamato since this evening.

00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:13.875
What did you say?

00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:19.563
Stop! Right there on the line!

00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:23.021
You crossed it just a moment ago.

00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:25.902
M-Mine doesn't count.

00:14:25.902 --> 00:14:28.298
Anyway, don't come any closer.

00:14:40.234 --> 00:14:43.202
I'll move away once the thunder stops.

00:14:44.989 --> 00:14:49.785
"Don't come closer"? Don't be so mean.

00:14:54.657 --> 00:14:56.474
I'm not being mean.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.404
I was keeping a distance intentionally.

00:15:03.197 --> 00:15:04.426
Huh?

00:15:05.677 --> 00:15:09.779
You're upset even though
our kiss was an accident, right?

00:15:11.122 --> 00:15:14.082
You must despise
being with a guy you dislike until morning.

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:17.121
I feel bad for you.

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.084
You're such a fool.

00:15:25.084 --> 00:15:27.307
Look who's talking.

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:31.917
You being scared of thunder isn't scary...

00:15:42.487 --> 00:15:44.053
I'll warm you up.

00:15:44.053 --> 00:15:47.997
I-It's okay. Really, it's fine.

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:50.711
I won't do anything.

00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:54.959
No teasing, and no harassment.

00:15:56.036 --> 00:15:57.576
So...

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:01.364
don't dislike me like that.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.216
Matsuri! Where are you?

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.088
Haruka?

00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:12.309
Here! I'm in here!

00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:14.316
The warehouse? In the warehouse!

00:16:14.316 --> 00:16:18.805
I figured, because her GPS
stopped working at school.

00:16:18.805 --> 00:16:19.879
What?

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:23.314
It's the power of love.

00:16:26.097 --> 00:16:27.664
- Matsuri.
- It won't open.

00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:29.046
- Matsuri!
- Are you okay?

00:16:29.046 --> 00:16:32.043
- Haruka, switch with me.
- Matsuri!

00:16:36.488 --> 00:16:38.104
Huh?

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.886
You guys...

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:44.264
Matsuri! Are you okay?

00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:47.728
Matsuri, are you alright?

00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:49.137
Matsuri.

00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:54.520
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.394
Luckily it didn't turn into a big deal.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.779
Just that, your dear little sister
ended up kissing me.

00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:04.858
A kiss?

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.762
I'm leaving now.

Matsuri!

00:17:27.935 --> 00:17:29.670
Whoa!

00:17:34.458 --> 00:17:38.380

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.860

I'm looking forward to your match.

00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:53.060
Hey, don't get in my way.

No bullying allowed.

00:17:54.337 --> 00:17:55.796
I won't.

00:17:55.796 --> 00:17:59.939
Because I just felt like stealing you,
even if you hate me.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:09.143
It's okay. You might as well
give your big brother to someone else.

00:18:12.847 --> 00:18:15.779
Don't touch my sister.

00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:17.215
Can we talk somewhere?

Huh?

00:18:27.851 --> 00:18:31.986
Am I going to get punched, maybe?

00:18:36.228 --> 00:18:43.010
Hey, Azusa, can I have your sister?

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.568
Yamato, I won't hand her over to you.

00:18:46.568 --> 00:18:48.476
Matsuri is mine.

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:52.857
You're quite on edge, Azusa.

00:18:52.857 --> 00:18:55.444
You don't come across as an idol.

00:18:55.444 --> 00:18:58.713
Maybe that's why you're losing to Prism.

00:18:58.713 --> 00:19:06.496
And then, before you know it,
even your sister will be mine.

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:11.254
Oh, the game is starting. See you later.

00:19:18.478 --> 00:19:19.957
Pass.

The winner is Class 1-B!

Amazing! You did it!

We won!

This year's female MVP is...
Matsuri Amamiya from Class 1-B!

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:24.306
Ms. Amamiya, please come to the stage.

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:26.156
Amamiya?

00:20:26.156 --> 00:20:28.316
Amamiya Matsuri?

00:20:29.248 --> 00:20:31.524
Amamiya?

Teacher.

Excuse me for a moment.

00:20:36.522 --> 00:20:41.529
Due to the MVP's request,
the prize has been changed.

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:45.084
It seems she has declined the prize.

00:20:45.084 --> 00:20:50.774
Instead, Terzetto will be doing
a special live performance for everyone!

00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:29.827
Quite a clever plan.

00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:36.427
This way, it protects your brothers,
and avoids any backlash, right?

00:21:36.427 --> 00:21:37.514
Yamato?

00:21:37.514 --> 00:21:40.772
Since you won, you should have
confidently taken it for yourself.

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:47.306
In retrospect, I realized everyone loves Terzetto.

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:55.385
Azusa said to me a while ago,
the audience's smiles are the best view.

00:21:56.866 --> 00:22:01.119
I don't want to steal those smiles.

00:22:02.129 --> 00:22:03.882
Is that so.

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:12.365

But you were joking, right?

00:22:27.139 --> 00:22:31.581
Well, when you talk about idols
so impressively like that,

00:22:32.205 --> 00:22:35.025
I can't say that confession was serious.

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:37.149
It would be uncool to admit that.

00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:43.186

00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:44.624
Wait.

I don't need a response
and hear that I'm being turned down.

And besides, I haven't given up yet.

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:59.553
