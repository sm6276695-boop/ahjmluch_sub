WEBVTT

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.560
Life is never fair.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Cheer up.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You brat.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Fatso.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
Serves you right!

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.560
Call the guards!

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.080
Help!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Is anyone there?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.680
Come and help!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.520
The analysis report
of the inhaler isn't out yet.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440
Who's in such a hurry...

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.680
to get rid of Ma Shan Bao?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720
What?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.520
Wasn't Xu Xiong the one
splashed with hot oil?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520
Yes.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.960
But at that time, Ma Shan Bao
was right next to Xu Xiong.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840
Who can say
that their real target...

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
wasn't Ma Shan Bao?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.360
Besides,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.640
Ma Shan Bao's identity...

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.760
has always been kept confidential.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.960
How would the informer know?

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.120
The subordinates?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440
Maybe the higher-ups too.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920
Who says confidential matters
are truly a secret?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920
Anyway, I think this whole thing...

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200
is very strange.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.520
Don't get involved in this mess.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.120
Just do your job.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.560
You have to protect yourself too.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.960
Ma Shan Bao is like a knife now.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.240
Everyone wants to use him
to stab each other to death.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.480
They won't stop.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.880
(Justice is Mine)

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.880
(Episode 5)

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.080
Officer Tang, welcome.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.640
Don't you have
a lot of cases to handle?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.680
Are you still
Ma Shan Bao's lawyer or not?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200
If you are,
please answer my question.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.880
If you're not,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.000
I won't waste your time.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Tell me.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.280
Don't you know that giving
an interview to the media...

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.920
would expose Ma Shan Bao's identity?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.440
I never mentioned...

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.800
Ma Shan Bao's name.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.960
But you said he is
from the Old City District.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400
Did Ma Shan Bao
ever mention to you...

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.400
that he is involved
in a hit-and-run case?

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.920
I don't have to tell you...

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.440
about my conversations
with my client.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
You don't have to say anything,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.840
but I can tell you this.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.120
The person who is critically
injured in the accident...

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.560
and is still in a coma in the ICU...

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.960
is Han Gang,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.000
Han Kui Long's eldest son.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200
Do you know that the police...

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.000
are doing everything
to seal the information?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640
Your interview exposed it all!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.600
I was just stating facts.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200
His name is Xu Xiong.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.560
He works for Qi Chang Rong
in the Old City Gang.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.400
When he was splashed with hot oil,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.760
he was right next to Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.360
The police are not ruling out...

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640
that their real target
was Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320
Who did it?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.160
The police have placed
Ma Shan Bao...

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.720
under protective custody.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.240
He has been transferred
to a single cell.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
If you still insist...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.280
on bailing him out,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.080
no one can guarantee...

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.200
his personal safety.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
Think about it carefully.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520
Ma Shan Bao.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Why aren't you eating?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.520
Who splashed hot oil on Da Xiong?

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.720
Do you even need to ask?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.440
Of course he works for the Hans.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.840
They've always been at odds
with the Old City Gang.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.040
Everyone knows that.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.920
But this time, their attack...

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.400
was indeed a bit too heavy-handed.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.720
You're also
from the Old City District.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.280
Be careful.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.120
Did my lawyer come by?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040
No.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.960
I want to call her.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.720
Hello, this is the voice mailbox
of Ms. Zhou Luo Wen. I...

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.960
Hello, this is the voice mailbox
of Ms. Zhou Luo Wen.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.440
I can't come to the phone right now.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.640
Please leave a message.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.080
Protective custody?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.040
Why don't you just tell...

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.200
that lawyer to shut up?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.960
In doing this, how are we different
from Han Kui Long?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Officer Hu.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.400
We can't just sit and do nothing...

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400
like Officer Da.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.640
Now, Xu Xiong and Han Gang...

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.800
are in the same hospital.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.200
If we don't do something,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.800
the hospital could turn
into a battlefield at any time.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520
Come in.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.680
Boss, Madam.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.600
You'd better come out
and take a look.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240
Boss, Madam.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
- Madam.
- Boss.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520
What is this?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.720
It's from Qi Chang Rong.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.240
I don't know what he means.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.120
It's clearly an offering.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.240
Xu Xiong works for him.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.600
He's demonstrating against us.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160
No.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.680
The person he wants
to make an offering to...

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
is Han Kui Long.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.240
"Officer, please deliver
this to Han Kui Long."

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.320
"Since he has a soft spot
for hot oil,"

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.800
"I'll treat him
to deep-fried pig's head..."

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.920
"to return the favor."

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.720
Isn't Qi Chang Rong too arrogant?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.240
This is clearly a provocation.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680
Why don't we throw it away?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.920
It's too unlucky.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240
We can't throw it away.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920
It's a token from him.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.320
How can we waste it?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.880
You're going to deliver it?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.880
Since it's a custom-made
home-style dish...

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.680
for Han Kui Long,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.600
I should deliver it while it's hot.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.920
(Gift)

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.360
I knew you guys would come.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.680
But I didn't think...

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.720
you would come personally.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440
Eat it while it's hot.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.960
It's a token from him.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.720
You went through the trouble...

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.160
of delivering takeout
for that mad dog.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080
Aren't you afraid
people might say...

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.320
that the police and triads
are working together?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.840
It's just a pig's head.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.880
No wonder you splashed
hot oil on people...

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.200
just because of an anonymous call.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.440
If you can't hand him over,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.720
maybe it's not just
hot oil next time.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.880
Your eldest son didn't die.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.920
He's still alive.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.560
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.160
He's as good...

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640
as dead now.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.120
I know you guys...

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.880
found the suspect.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.600
I also know...

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840
that you have...

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.480
an inhaler...

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.080
found at the scene,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.760
right?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.440
You don't have to tell me.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.960
Even if you don't,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.080
I can still find him.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.800
Then I can also just randomly...

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.280
point out someone
from the Old City District...

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
say he did it,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.200
and watch him die on the street.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.880
You'll be pleased,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280
and I can close the case.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.760
It's a win-win.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.360
But you know I won't do that.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.120
I'm not one of those corrupt cops
you bribed.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.840
I knew you...

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.640
didn't just come here
to deliver takeout.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080
I will surely...

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.520
investigate this case.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.720
But I need time.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920
Okay.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.680
Take your time.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.840
While you can't find anything,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.320
you'll have...

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680
to collect bodies every day.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.800
Be gentle, miss.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920
Hang in there.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.240
- All right.
- Hang in there, son.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.440
I heard your youngest son
Han Lie is back.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600
What's the matter?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.280
His dad is in jail,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.920
his big brother is in a coma,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.760
so it's his turn to step up?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.960
Having brotherly love...

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.120
is human nature.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.160
Or maybe it's the love
between father and son?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.080
He can be imprisoned with you.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
Do you have proof?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.480
According to your rules,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.080
no proof is needed.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.880
If I say he did it, he did.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.040
But I know...

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.360
Han Gang is your successor.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.920
To you,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.640
protecting your eldest son
is the most important thing.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800
Name your price.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.920
We will surely continue
investigating this case.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.400
But in the meantime,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.760
don't play any tricks.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.280
And don't let your men outside
cause trouble.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.720
Especially your youngest son
Han Lie.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.960
I've requested approval
from the higher-ups.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.560
You can go out
and visit your eldest son once.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.640
(Special Visitation Permission)

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560
Twice.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160
Han!

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.680
How's the pig's head?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680
Hey, Qi Chang Rong.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.920
If the oil's not hot enough,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.120
the skin won't be crispy.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.560
Then I'll fry it crispier next time!

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.600
Shut up!

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.480
Just stay put.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720
Let's go!

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.600
Darn you.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.360
Hands up.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280
Turn around.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400
Turn around.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.480
Hang in there.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440
Son.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440
Tell me.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.760
Do you have anything to do...

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.920
with what happened to Da Xiong?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.320
You asked me
to persuade Bao to confess.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160
You said that money...

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.240
was to buy his time in prison.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.120
It turns out that what you bought...

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.120
is Bao's life.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.160
What money?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.320
When Da Xiong got hurt,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320
Bao was also beside him.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.760
Who knows who's next?

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.240
What's this money
Xiao Xue is talking about?

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320
I got the best doctor.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.160
Da Xiong will surely be fine.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.480
I wonder who Da Xiong...

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.440
has offended.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120
Don't worry.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480
Da Xiong is my buddy.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800
He's my family too.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:09.920
So is Bao.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.840
If anything happens,
you can tell me.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.200
As long as I, Qi Chang Rong,
am in the Old City District,

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.960
I'll get revenge.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.960
Tell me what's up with that money.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.840
Why did you give money to Xiao Xue?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.400
Where did you get that money?

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.000
How much did you give her?

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.720
Honey, I'm terrified.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.640
Our two kids are so young.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.240
I'm so scared of Qi Chang Rong.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
I know.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.720
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.040
I'm more scared of something
happening to you now!

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.760
What exactly happened that night?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.000
Why is Bao detained by the police...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.040
and can't be bailed out?

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.200
What are you and Judge Qin
hiding from me?

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.160
Tell me!

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840
Who is it?

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080
Judge Qin.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.120
Answer it.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400
Answer it.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040
Fine, if you won't, I will.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200
You...

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560
Judge Qin.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560
Get ready for court.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.760
Is my brother in better condition?

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.960
There's no noticeable improvement.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.720
But thankfully,
he's not getting worse.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.480
However, after lying down
for too long,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.640
his muscles will atrophy easily.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200
When you have time,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.840
you can massage his hands and legs.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.040
It'll help with blood circulation.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.640
I'm really not used to my brother
being like this.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.120
When he went out to fight before,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.360
he would never stop...

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.080
until everyone was knocked down.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800
Don't make a brawl...

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.240
sound so grand.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
Aren't you scared of me?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840
What's there to be afraid of?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.960
Then why don't you dare
to look at me?

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960
Hello?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.080
One sandwich.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840
Also,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200
I want...

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760
a bubble tea.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800
This is for you.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400
I misunderstood you before.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.280
People like you...

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.440
don't know how to apologize, do you?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920
Do you want me to say it?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040
I don't drink milk tea.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680
Then throw it away.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.560
I don't take back...

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.080
what I've given away.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560
Hey.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800
This is for you.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600
Thanks.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520
There's no straw.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.040
Young Master Lie, your sandwich.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480
Where's the milk tea?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.960
You can go first.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.960
I just got out of the hospital.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.040
Yi Wei.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120
In the next two days,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.480
stay at your grandma's first.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640
What's the matter?

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.040
I'm very busy lately.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.560
If you stay at her house,
someone can take care of you.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.720
Her house is also close
to your school.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.160
- Good morning, Judge Qin.
- Inspector Tang.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360
Can we talk inside?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920
Please come in.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.680
Good morning.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.520
A friend at the Report Center
informed me...

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.680
that you called the police
last night.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040
I've already checked for you.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.760
It seems like someone
tried to break in.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.280
We've increased police patrols...

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280
in the area.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.000
Thank you for coming all this way.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.480
I'm a bit worried...

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.160
that they haven't given up...

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
since the bomb scare last time.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.800
That's why we handled it
for you at once.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.480
Anyway, be careful...

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480
when you go out lately.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320
Is there anything else?

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.520
I need to take him to school.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.400
If you have any questions,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.560
call me anytime.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840
Okay.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.080
Take care.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440
Bye.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640
Coach.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520
I'm sorry.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.040
You got dragged into this
because of me.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.920
It's okay. It's all in the past,
let's not talk about it.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.720
I drank because I was upset.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.520
I miss my mom a lot.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560
I am...

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960
from a single-parent family too.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.960
I know your mom...

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.960
passed away.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.680
But that's no reason to drink.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
No.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120
It's different.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960
My mom...

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.920
committed suicide.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160
Hello?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.040
They've placed Bao
in a single cell.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.720
I don't know if they're trying
to protect him...

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720
or deal with him.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.520
- Calm down.
- How can I calm down?

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.400
How can I explain this
to his family?

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720
There's no turning back now.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
I think surrendering...

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.440
might be the best way.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.880
- We can still turn things around.
- No...

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.880
We absolutely cannot do that.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200
If we do that,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.560
you'll really hurt him and yourself.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200
Last night,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.880
some strangers were standing
in front of my house.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Who were they?

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.920
I don't know.
They left when I walked out.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.920
But I suspect...

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.400
they might be Han Kui Long's people.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.720
Even he knows about it?

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.520
I'm not sure about that.
But I am certain...

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.400
that he won't let this go.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.640
If you call the police,
he'll find out.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.480
When that happens, you won't be able
to get away with it.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.200
You have a wife and kids at home.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320
Then what should we do?

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.560
The only thing we can do now is...

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.120
Bao absolutely cannot plead guilty.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.400
If Bao pleads guilty,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.680
Han Kui Long will kill everyone...

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
involved in this case.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.800
Including me and my son,

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.800
you, your wife,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
and your two kids.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.200
Remember.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.240
We can't say anything now,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600
Bao too.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.480
But I can't reach Bao.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760
Why not?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.760
After I gave the money last time,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.120
he and his mom
don't trust me anymore.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.640
Even my wife is watching me closely.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.680
What about Ms. Zhou?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.360
Ms. Zhou told me...

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120
she quit.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Hey, Luo Wen.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.960
Are... Are you all right?

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.880
Have some water.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920
Thank you.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560
So,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880
do you feel any better?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.960
I'm not drunk.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040
I'm just...

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.600
a little depressed and unwell.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.360
I'm sorry.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.560
I messed up the case you gave me.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640
Don't be silly.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.240
When it comes to lawsuits,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.880
you either win or lose it.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.320
You're not giving up, are you?

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.160
Sometimes, I wish...

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.200
I can be as strong as you, Mr. Qin.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.560
Actually, I'm not as strong
as you think.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.520
After my wife passed away,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.760
I felt like...

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.160
I lost my sense of direction.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.880
My wife committed suicide.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.360
The biggest reason
I can't move on...

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.800
is because I still
don't understand...

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.280
why she did it.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.880
I can never understand it.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680
I think...

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.320
Mrs. Qin must have had her reasons.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.560
I believe you already did your best.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.440
But in this world,

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.080
not everything has an answer.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240
I've never...

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.000
told anyone about this.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.040
I just want you to know...

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.720
that be it a judge...

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840
or a lawyer,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.040
we can't show people...

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.120
our weaknesses.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120
Because these weaknesses...

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.280
can be taken advantage of.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.960
What exactly happened?

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.440
Tang Xuan came to see me.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.720
She also showed me a photo.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.720
It was of a young man
badly burned by hot oil.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.560
It was because I went
to the Old City District,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.600
because I accepted
the media's interview.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.720
This all started because of me.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.920
You only told me
that Ma Shan Bao stole a car.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.920
But now,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.440
it already involves
gang revenge and killings.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.920
I can't do it.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400
I really can't do it.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.760
Inspector Tang...

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.680
just arrested a suspect...

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280
while investigating these cases.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.400
Her only goal now...

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.800
is to find as much evidence
as possible...

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.160
to charge the suspect.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440
And it's very obvious...

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.720
that she doesn't have
enough evidence now.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.040
How do you know?

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520
If she has enough evidence,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.960
she wouldn't have threatened you
with the photo.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.480
They said Ma Shan Bao
is in danger now.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.400
Putting him in protective custody...

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.680
is the safest thing to do.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.920
They said that to buy time...

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160
to interrogate the criminal.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.000
This is what they usually do.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.920
Why did you go
to the Old City District?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.800
I went to look
for Ma Shan Bao's alibi.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.680
What alibi?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.440
At the time of the car accident,

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.960
Ma Shan Bao
was stealing another car.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.000
That's his alibi.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.320
- Hello?
- I'm Han Lie.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.080
This is my personal number.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560
It's faster to call you directly...

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.400
than to the police station.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.040
They killed someone
who works for me.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440
We're currently investigating...

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.680
who did it.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.520
He was burned alive,

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.440
then thrown into the trash
like garbage.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.960
He has a three-year-old
at home, Madam.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
I told you.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.000
The police are looking into it.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.880
Do you still need to look into it?

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.200
Who else could it be
other than Qi Chang Rong?

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560
Also,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.040
what about my brother's case?

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.760
You said you're looking into it too.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.040
Where's the culprit?

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760
Have you caught him?

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.600
What about the hot oil case?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.480
Do you have any exclusive leads...

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.680
that you can share with the police?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Young Master Lie.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240
Young Master Lie.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.240
Young Master Lie.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840
Young Master Lie.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.840
We've sent people
to Iron Head's house...

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:02.840
to appease his family.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.800
We've arranged the compensation
according to your wishes too.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800
It's all done.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.520
He was with me for so many years.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.760
No matter what,

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.520
I want him to die with dignity.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.440
Qi Chang Rong is so arrogant.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.840
We must retaliate.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040
Mr. Long said...

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.960
we can't act on our own.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920
What does that mean?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.320
Hire a bodyguard, hide at home,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600
and be a coward?

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720
Xiao Lie.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280
Don't be so angry.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.600
Your brother is in the hospital.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.960
If anything happens outside,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.080
we'll be at a disadvantage.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.960
You have to trust your dad.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.600
He's not staying put now...

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.800
because he's a coward.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.960
He has his own plan.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.200
It's not that I don't trust him.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.000
I don't trust those cops.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.680
If we can bribe dirty cops,

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.200
so can Qi Chang Rong.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.840
No one can be trusted.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.840
I can only rely on myself.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.880
Wait, what did you say?

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.240
He was stealing another car?

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.360
What alibi?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.360
What did Ma Shan Bao tell you?

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.040
I can't disclose my conversation
with my client.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.040
Didn't you teach me this, Mr. Qin?

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.800
Yes...

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.720
I just think that Ma Shan Bao...

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.880
has a criminal record,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320
so I don't know...

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.920
if we can trust what he says.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.520
He has another accomplice.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.640
I went to the Old City District
to find him.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.720
Another accomplice?

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.960
Who is it? What's his name?

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.600
I want to help you analyze it.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.880
I know.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.800
He's from the Old City District too.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.520
He's a year younger
than Ma Shan Bao.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800
Did you find him?

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160
Don't get me started.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.040
As soon as I went in there,
they chased me away with a broom...

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.360
and kept scolding me.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.960
Actually, most people...

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.280
in the Old City District
work for Qi Chang Rong.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.600
The information you get there...

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960
is unreliable.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.000
I think you should...

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.120
focus on Ma Shan Bao.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.080
As you also know,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.800
he's in solitary confinement now.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.040
He must feel very lonely...

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160
and helpless.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.880
If even you won't help him,

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.800
no one will.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.640
What should I tell him?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.680
You'd better tell him
not to say anything.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.320
Because no matter what he says,

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.640
he'll be misunderstood.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560
You're Judge Qin?

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.880
Mrs. Cao, is Wei here?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.320
Unless you tell me what you guys
and Bao did that night...

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880
Who is it?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.640
What's with the money and the car?

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.640
Tell me quickly.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640
Give me the phone.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720
Give it to me.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240
Give it to me.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.120
- Hello?
- Wei.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.800
You have to help me with this.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.080
Otherwise, we're both dead.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.040
There's a young man named Xiao Bei
in the Old City District.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.920
He's 17 years old.
His family owns a grocery store.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.920
Do you know him?

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.840
You just want water?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840
Do you want something to eat?

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920
No, thank you.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.120
If you find him,
tell him to hide for a while.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.840
My wife is more familiar
with the Old City District.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480
I'll ask her.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960
Did you meet him?

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200
No, I couldn't meet him.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.120
They said Ma Shan Bao went
to the infirmary.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.760
I know...

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.240
you cherish your friendship...

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.680
with Judge Qin.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.520
But whether it's Qi Chang Rong
or Han Kui Long,

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.400
we can't afford to mess with them.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.360
Do you know someone named Xiao Bei?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800
He's 17 years old.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.480
His family owns a grocery store.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560
Why are you looking for him?

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.080
I can't tell you.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.320
Don't you remember...

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.600
we still have two children at home?

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.200
I'm doing this for our children...

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.200
and this family.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.120
I have no choice.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760
I'm not going home yet.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120
I'm going to the police station.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.600
What? Wait... Wait a moment.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240
What's the matter?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.480
Ma Shan Bao said...

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.720
it was an old white Mercedes.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.480
I'll ask them to check...

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.240
if Ma Shan Bao's
fingerprints are on the car...

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.480
and interrogate the friend...

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.840
who stole the car with him.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.880
How credible is that?

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.560
Actually, I have
a trick up my sleeve.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160
Look.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.960
This should be
the car Ma Shan Bao stole.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.640
Once we find that car,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.240
we can prove Ma Shan Bao's alibi.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.800
At the same time,

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.120
we can also prove that the real
culprit is someone else.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.640
My car...

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.560
went missing that morning.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.960
How do you know that?

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200
Because that morning,

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.760
when I went out around 10 am,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320
I found Ma Shan Bao...

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640
near my house.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400
What?

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.680
When I identified him
at the police station,

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.160
I already told the police.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.280
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.360
Because there is a two-hour gap...

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.360
between my lost car
and the accident.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.960
- No, shouldn't you have told me?
- A lot of things...

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960
could have happened
during this period of time.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.160
- This is a very important clue.
- Maybe Ma Shan Bao stole my car.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.120
Or someone could have driven
my car and hit someone.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.720
Why didn't you tell me
that you identified Ma Shan Bao?

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.920
I didn't want to cloud
your judgment, so I didn't tell you.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.200
Do you want to give up on this case?

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840
Three hours ago,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.920
I did want to give up on this case.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.160
- You can tell him.
- You told me not to give up!

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.440
You can tell him.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.280
Tell him Ma Shan Bao
is willing to admit...

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.800
to unauthorized use of a vehicle.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.680
For this crime,
the maximum sentence is two years.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.280
Then ask for probation,

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.880
and he might be out in three months.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.640
Do you think Han Kui Long
will be patient enough...

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.560
to let Ma Shan Bao
walk out of prison alive?

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.880
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.880
Yes.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.680
I'm a lawyer.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.760
You were once a lawyer too.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.440
A lawyer's duty is to protect...

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.920
the client's best interest.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
I'm sorry, Mr. Qin.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.120
I think there are...

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.320
many irregularities in this case.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.040
I'll continue to handle
this case my way.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.760
Inspector Tang.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.720
I told you back then...

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720
that when the accident happened,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.440
my client was stealing this car.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.200
The young man with Ma Shan Bao
was Xiao Bei.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.600
He's 17 years old,
also from the Old City District.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.880
His family owns a grocery store.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.560
If we can prove...

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.360
that Ma Shan Bao wasn't the one
who hit Han Gang with a car,

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.960
then Han Kui Long has no reason...

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.080
to start a war
with the Old City District.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.840
Turn off the engine.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.240
I'm more familiar
with the Old City District.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.040
I can go by myself.
Wait for me here.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.840
No. This concerns both of us.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
I'll go with you.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.800
I can handle it myself.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.920
You still have to be
the Chief Justice.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920
Don't take the risk.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.040
I'm the one who dragged you down.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480
Let's go together.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.760
That car should be up ahead.

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.080
- This one...
- It's this one?

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960
Wei.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Wei.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.560
A police car is coming.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720
Run.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080
Where?

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160
Behind you.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840
Come on.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.680
Hurry. Come on!
