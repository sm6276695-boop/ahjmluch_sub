(Justice is Mine)

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.280
(Episode 7)

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.440
Sir, turn on the radio.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.160
After financial news comes the local news.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.399
A shooting took place...

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.320
in the Old City District early this morning.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.440
The police suspects that it's related to a car accident before.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.519
It is reported that the victim is an 18-year-old boy...

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.560
with the surname Ma.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
According to witnesses,

00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.279
several men drove a champagne-colored sedan...

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.640
and parked in front of Ma's house.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.399
Afterwards, two masked men...

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.856
- started shooting at Ma, - Stop, sir!

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.120
Leading to his death.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.480
The police are doing their best to track him down.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.200
Who told you to do that?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.680
We received a tip-off call last night.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.080
This time, he gave a name and location.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440
Are you sure...

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.479
that mad dog Qi Chang Rong...

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.360
didn't use you to kill and silence that person?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.920
The one who was killed was part of the Old City Gang.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
For my brother,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400
and for Iron Head's revenge, it was worth doing it.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.160
Who did it?

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
To avenge my brother,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.240
I had to do it myself.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.239
The police will surely look for you.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.280
I don't care.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.440
I took care of everything.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.920
What should I be afraid of?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.720
Do you know how much trouble you've caused?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280
You killed this brat,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.240
and you think you're so great.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.200
If it were your brother,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.760
he'd wipe out the entire Old City Gang...

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.160
and not leave anyone behind.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.840
But what matters most...

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.240
is that your brother...

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.080
can walk out of the hospital healthily.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.559
The most important thing...

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.280
is to keep him alive.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720
Do you understand?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
Answer me!

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280
I understand.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.760
I'm going back to pee!

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920
Qin Yu.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
Come in.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280
Okay.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.800
Did I make a mistake?

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.240
I shouldn't have let him out.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.160
I've taught you before.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
To get information,

00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:35.880
you have to take them by surprise.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.760
It's all about strategy.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.280
It's not against the rules to follow the procedure, right?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400
Besides,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.640
even if that's not the case,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.560
Ma Shan Bao would have bailed himself out sooner or later.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.920
Whoever wants to kill him...

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.640
could do that as well.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.239
But the problem is no one knows...

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240
that he was out on bail.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.560
On the first day, he...

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.399
Is everything I say...

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.079
eavesdropped on and leaked?

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.560
Okay... Calm down...

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.279
You can say talk all you want, but don't touch anything on my desk.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.079
- Okay? - I've never felt that the mole...

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.160
is this close to me before.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.720
He's always one step ahead of me.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360
Are you scared?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.760
Do you feel scared now?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.160
I saw Qi Chang Rong earlier.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.239
On his turf, Han Kui Long...

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.560
blatantly killed people.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.880
He'll surely retaliate.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.840
I'll send someone now...

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.200
to watch him 24 hours a day.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
Is he awake?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.920
Did he say anything to you?

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.679
He only told me...

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.000
you're taking him abroad.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.080
I want to hear the rest from you.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.599
I'll take him home first.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.320
- We can talk later. - Don't go up yet.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.640
Make things clear first.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.159
Why did you tell me...

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.680
not to let Wei Wei go out last night?

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.520
It's because...

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.600
he was a little emotionally unstable last night.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.760
We had a fight.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.559
Wei Wei is still young.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.320
Why do you suddenly want to take him away?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.080
I have my reasons.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.119
Then make it clear to me.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.400
What exactly is going on?

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.360
Are you hiding something from me?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.960
Yesterday,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.079
I went to the bank...

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.520
to save some money for Wei Wei.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.920
I checked the balance,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600
and I was shocked.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.360
It turns out that you withdrew all the money.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.080
What exactly is going on?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.560
Can I have some water?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.320
Thank you.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
Tell me.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400
Recently,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.520
I found out that Yi Wei is dating his teacher.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.120
She is the female coach of the school's basketball team,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.040
who's a few years older than him.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.880
I can't believe this.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.680
They drank at school before,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.400
which alarmed the school.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.920
As a parent,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.800
I attended their hearing.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.440
He's with a female coach?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.880
Maybe after my wife passed away,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.880
he misses his mom too much...

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.760
that he wants someone to talk to...

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880
and let it all out.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.520
Actually,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.359
I also want to take Yi Wei to Canada...

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
for a semester.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.680
That's why I withdrew all the money.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.600
Are you really willing to go with him?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.376
You'll resign from your job...

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.640
and even quit being a judge?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.800
Yes.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.320
If you could think this way before,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.800
would my daughter still commit suicide?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.080
You still owe me an answer about that.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.720
How can I have an answer? I don't know why either.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.640
I just know that after my wife died,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.840
I have to be nicer to Yi Wei.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.200
What kind of coach is she?

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.679
Can she be called a teacher?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
She has no morals.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.520
I'm going to complain to the school.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.759
There's no need, I've dealt with it.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.919
Your way of dealing with it is letting Wei Wei leave...

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.039
the surroundings...

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.280
and friends he's familiar with?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480
Okay.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640
We can further discuss...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.080
whether he'll leave or not.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.680
Have a good talk with him.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.440
Don't upset him again.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.320
Okay, I will.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.360
Let's go.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960
Where are we going?

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160
Home.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720
Come on.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200
Dad.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.600
Can you tell me what happened?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.120
Let's talk when we get home.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920
Okay.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680
I understand.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.800
Don't worry, I'll pass the message for you.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.960
Okay... Bye.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
Excuse me.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.040
How long do I have to wait to see Inspector Tang?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640
Madam is still busy.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.120
Do you want me to make an appointment for you?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.200
There's no need.

00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:16.241
I'll keep waiting for her.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440
We're home. Now,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080
can you tell me?

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.040
Have you ever heard of a cautionary statement?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.880
When you're not just a witness,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480
but also a suspect,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.880
after you're cautioned by the police,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.440
anything you say...

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.640
may be used against you in court.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.800
I was afraid I said the wrong thing,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.360
and they would find out.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.320
Did they find out then?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.720
I just confirmed this morning...

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.360
that they didn't find out anything.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.320
I was too nervous last night,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and I panicked.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.240
I was afraid that if I got arrested,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480
you would be left alone.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.920
And in the end,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.960
you would get caught too.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.480
I was too scared to even continue thinking about it,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.120
so I wanted to run away.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.280
But it's fine now.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.520
Are you sure?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720
I'm sure.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
I'm sorry.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.479
You have a message.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.320
To listen to this message, press one.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.520
Judge Qin.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.640
Bao won't say anything.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.280
Don't worry. It's fine now.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.440
Dad, let's order takeout this afternoon, okay?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.960
Okay. Order it.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840
Inspector Tang.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
Get to work first.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.336
What can I do for you, Ms. Zhou?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.719
Ma Shan Bao was shot to death...

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.120
under the police's protection.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.360
There is clearly a mole in the police force.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.759
I strongly urge the police...

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.920
to give an explanation at once for Ma Shan Bao's death.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.640
The case is under investigation.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.680
You know he's not the killer.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.920
He had an alibi.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.440
He was framed as a scapegoat.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.400
The police needs evidence to arrest people.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.720
When gangsters kill people,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.536
they'd rather kill the wrong person than let anyone go.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.639
Xu Xiong being splashed with hot oil...

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.880
is a perfect example!

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.560
- What are you trying to say? - I'm saying...

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.039
that bailing out Ma Shan Bao...

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.279
would surely put him in danger.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.856
He'd be involved in gangster vendetta for sure.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.759
Why did you have to bail him out?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.799
Because I thought you guys...

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.880
could protect him!

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.439
Besides the prosecutor and I,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.600
you knew...

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800
he was going home too.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120
When you made a big fuss...

00:16:58.121 --> 00:16:59.199
and drove to the Old City District,

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.640
did you think about this?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.880
Providing information...

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.000
in exchange for getting escorted abroad.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.320
Did you really have information to exchange with me,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.000
or were you playing legal tricks?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.360
Such legal tricks that only experts can play...

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.880
is not something a newbie like you can come up with.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.080
Who exactly taught you that?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240
Wei.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.600
How long have we been together?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600
The kids are asleep.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.600
Don't wake them up.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.759
I don't care if you're still a cop or not.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.600
I don't care if you make more than you used to.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.520
I made a vow when we got married.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.999
No matter what happens,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.200
I'll be by your side.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.400
I just want our family to be well.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920
But what about you?

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.560
Have you forgotten your vow?

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.880
I didn't know it would turn out like this too.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.359
If something happened to us yesterday,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.719
what would our kids do?

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.799
I didn't know this would happen.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.399
Since the night Bao came to our house...

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.680
until he was arrested,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.240
it has been two weeks.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.000
Two whole weeks.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440
If you thought about it,

00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:11.799
that means you don't care...

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.000
about our family at all.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.319
Wei, I want to leave this place.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320
I want to leave you.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
Why?

00:18:18.921 --> 00:18:19.999
I'm taking the kids with me.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Hey.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.720
I just want to live in peace.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.159
After Bao's funeral,

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160
I'll take the kids...

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
to my parents' house.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960
Sha Sha.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720
It's Judge Qin, right?

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.480
Answer it.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.519
Ask him if he knows that our family...

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.720
is in shambles because of him.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.920
Sha Sha.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.319
Don't act this way.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.920
Just because he helped you before,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.279
you're willing to give up this family...

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.480
and risk your life for him?

00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760
Hello?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.120
My phone's battery was dead.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.480
I just heard your message.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.400
Didn't you say everything was fine?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.119
How did this happen?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.760
How would I know?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.840
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.080
What's the use of apologizing?

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.280
Will Bao come back to life?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
How about this?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.479
If Bao's family needs anything,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.359
let me know, and I'll see if I can help.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.680
I don't dare to trouble you.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.759
I'm afraid someone might die again.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.920
Don't call me again.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480
Mr. Qin.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.240
What's up?

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.040
I got Ma Shan Bao killed, didn't I?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.016
I shouldn't have listened to your suggestion.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.400
I shouldn't have bailed him out.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.040
This way, he wouldn't have died.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.560
Did you forget what I told you?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.280
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680
He was only 18 years old.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.920
If he were your son,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840
would you still say that?

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200
A lawyer...

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.296
must maintain some distance from his client...

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.800
in order to demonstrate his expertise.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.760
Now that he's dead,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.600
this case is also closed.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
It's not closed.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.680
Ma Shan Bao was not just my client.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.800
He was also a living person.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.760
I want to prove his innocence.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120
Come on.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200
Let's go.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920
Come on, get in the car.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.240
Xiao Jun.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.120
Listen to your mom.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.360
Take good care of your sister, okay?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120
Good boy.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880
Xiao Jun.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040
Go.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640
Come on.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960
Drive.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.080
The shooting today...

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.920
may have been a battle...

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.240
between two different gangs.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.896
According to the ex officio council member Huang Xiao,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.559
the violent battle...

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.296
between the Old City Gang and the Han Gang...

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.399
slowly started intensifying...

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.080
after a hit-and-run incident...

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280
two weeks ago.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.320
According to the police,

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.760
the shooting victim was an 18-year-old male...

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.160
from the Old City District, Ma Shan Bao.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.600
- And this shooting incident... - Did we kill him?

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
Didn't you hear it?

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.040
It was an accident from gangster vendetta.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320
No one...

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.080
could have stopped an accident.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.280
It's in the past now.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.480
Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.800
I'll have dinner with you tonight.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.760
I'm eating vegetarian food this week.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.560
What we eat doesn't matter.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.000
Ms. Ying, add a place setting.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520
Okay.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400
Young Master Lie.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.000
According to Mr. Long's rule before,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.640
we'll light memorial candles...

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.800
to pray for the deceased.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.200
Is this arrangement okay?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.240
No wonder you came back to have dinner with me.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.160
I know that on this month every year,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.880
you eat vegetarian food for your deceased family.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.920
My dad can't be with you this year,

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.360
so I'll keep you company.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.720
For the other things I do,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.200
he might not be satisfied.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.960
Okay, let's eat.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.880
(Huyan Wooden Shed Area Late Refugees Memorial)

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120
Dad, Mom,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480
little brothers.

00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:00.639
(Lin Han Wen, Zhou Hui Fang, Lin Yong Xi, Lin Yong...)

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640
I came to visit you.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.880
I'm great, don't worry.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.120
It's been 20 years in the blink of an eye.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.599
In that fire back then,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.000
104 people were killed,

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.000
and 200 people were injured.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.560
Those who survived...

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.920
all started a new life.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.999
Many people have forgotten...

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.080
how unfair their loved ones died.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.480
I'm the only one left in our family of five.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.040
How could I forget?

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.800
Although the arsonist is dead,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.360
so many people's lives...

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.200
have changed because of it.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760
It was the same for you.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.879
I didn't know you'd be with Han Kui Long...

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.520
after the fire.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.640
He was the only one who took care of me back then.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
You're doing well too.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.520
You became a cop.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.800
You still haven't found Liu Mao?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.639
After his girlfriend died,

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.999
he lost all contact.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.520
We grew up together.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.720
I wonder how he's doing now.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.759
Our family has been busy lately.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760
I'll get going.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560
Hey, Lin Qian.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.160
After what happened to Han Gang,

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.920
it's probably quite chaotic out here now.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.200
Be careful.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.080
I'm just Mr. Long's woman.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.639
I'm helping him run the Han household...

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.840
and take care of his two sons.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.736
I pass on messages for you guys when I have time.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.320
I'm not involved in anything else.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.160
Anyway, just be careful.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.160
Okay.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.880
Officer Shi.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.480
I thought you wouldn't come today.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.440
I said I could empathize with you.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920
But this time,

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.760
it really pains me.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.080
What's the matter? Is it Ma Shan Bao's case?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.160
People always say that the heavens is watching us.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.160
Is the heavens really watching?

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.800
On your side,

00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:04.079
hundreds of lives...

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.280
haven't gotten justice.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960
On my side,

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.280
another innocent person just died.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.600
Let's not talk about my side first.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.080
As police officers,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.599
we've surely encountered people we couldn't save...

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.960
or cases we couldn't solve.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.440
I get it.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.880
But it really doesn't feel good.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.399
I understand.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.040
It's normal.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.440
You're human too.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.839
No matter how many times you go through it,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.920
it'll still hurt.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.679
Luckily, you have me.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.960
You have me by your side, right?

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.639
Today, I think...

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.856
I'm the one who should be here for you.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.920
Whatever.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120
Anyway,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.440
it's fine as long as we're together.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240
Then...

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.839
are we still going there today?

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840
Of course.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.760
Then it's time for you to let go.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.160
Why?

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.480
There's no one here.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.360
If you don't let go, it'll be dark by the time we get there.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.520
You drive your car, I'll drive mine.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.320
See you later.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.520
Lin Qian's four family members...

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.560
and my three family members...

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.040
are all down there.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.999
Can the prosperity on the outside...

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.039
really hide...

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.480
the dirty things behind it?

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.999
Both you and Lin Qian...

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.080
became orphans because of this fire.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.720
You need her to help you...

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.080
find clues about the fire,

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.360
but you don't want to tell her...

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.440
what you're really investigating.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.160
After all, Lin Qian is Han Kui Long's woman.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.400
Her identity is very sensitive.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.000
An investigation is always...

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.919
the police's business.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.480
There's no need to drag her into this.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.000
Speaking of investigations,

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.000
you know my boss Officer Hu...

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.600
has a problem with you, right?

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.120
He doesn't have a problem with me.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.599
He has a problem with my boss,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.800
Da Gama.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440
Hey.

00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:10.640
After all, they joined the force at the same time.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.320
Now my boss Da Gama is the Chief Superintendent.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.200
And Inspector Hu is still a Chief Inspector.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.559
Inspector Hu really dislikes Officer Da...

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.039
for not using forceful means...

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.376
to get rid of corrupt police officers.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.679
It's not that he didn't.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.720
He just didn't dare.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.240
Hey.

00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:29.039
The interests involved behind the scenes...

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040
are too complicated.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.840
It's rare for you to defend him.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.400
I'm not speaking up for him.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.920
I just want to tell you...

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.479
that in this day and age,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.000
cops can't be so naive.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.759
But if I can't even trust...

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.200
our own colleagues,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.080
isn't it too sad...

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.040
to be a police officer?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
You don't have to be sad.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.200
You can always trust...

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760
me.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880
Here, have a seat.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
I don't have a choice.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.200
I couldn't go with you this year.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.559
Luo Qiang already did what you wanted...

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.880
and lit the memorial candles.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.440
It's the thought that counts.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.160
When Xiao Gang recovers,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.880
he can take care of you for me.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.120
Xiao Lie is great too.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440
Last night,

00:31:06.441 --> 00:31:08.161
he even came to eat vegetarian food with me.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.600
Xiao Lie's biggest problem...

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.600
is that he's not smart enough.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.160
He doesn't see the big picture.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.440
If it were Xiao Gang,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.720
I wouldn't have to worry so much.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400
So,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.080
how's Xiao Gang's progress?

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.560
The doctor said he's very stable.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.879
But whether or not he'll improve...

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.080
depends on his own will.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.640
The son of Han Kui Long...

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.440
can surely get back on his feet.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440
I have a friend...

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.400
who can help you get a good discount.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400
How much discount?

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.520
Even 50 percent off is too expensive for me.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.160
It's not that bad.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.880
It's really pretty.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800
I'll get back to work.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
How can I help you?

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.080
I think my brother's IV drip is almost finished.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.560
That fast?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.560
It should only finish in half an hour.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680
Then...

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.000
come over in half an hour.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.520
Sure.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760
I'm sorry.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880
It's okay.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.840
Look at my brother.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.880
Does he feel pain?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280
Don't worry.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.600
With his brother's concern,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920
he should be able...

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.760
to handle this much pain.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320
Thank you.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240
Excuse me.

00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:16.000
Is Coach Yu here?

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.759
She's the one wearing a pink short-sleeved shirt.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760
Okay, thank you.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.640
- Coach Yu? - Yes.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200
My name is Shen Ning.

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.160
I'm Qin Yi Wei's grandmother.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.920
How can I help you?

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.120
I've heard...

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.880
about you and Wei Wei.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.400
Are you two dating?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.080
Who told you that?

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160
Coach Yu.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.120
Wei Wei is only 19.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.400
You may be very young,

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.080
but you're his teacher.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.320
A teacher dating a student...

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.599
is not inappropriate.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
Wait a minute.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.840
That never happened at all.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520
Wei Wei's dad said...

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.599
you drank with him at school...

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.416
and got a warning from the Academic Affairs Committee.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.440
That's what he said?

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.639
He knows what happened.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640
Why would he say that?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.160
What do you mean?

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680
Qin Yi Wei...

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.560
told me...

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.160
his mother committed suicide.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.519
I saw that he was in pain...

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.880
and couldn't take it easy,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.760
so I was concerned about him.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.120
I don't know if that's the reason...

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.759
why he projected his attachment to his mother...

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.000
onto me.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.600
Actually, adults like us know that this kind of behavior...

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.800
is due to their loneliness.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.399
He wants to find someone to talk to.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400
And I happen to be someone...

00:35:46.401 --> 00:35:47.600
who can listen to him.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120
Is that wrong too?

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.200
I'm sorry.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.800
I'm a straightforward person.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720
I'm sorry...

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040
for bothering you.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.440
Wait.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.440
There's one more thing.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.520
Qin Yi Wei gave me this necklace.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I already refused it,

00:36:17.001 --> 00:36:18.401
but he insisted on giving it to me.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.439
Qin Yi Wei and I...

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.920
have never been in a relationship.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.200
Even a judge...

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.999
can't just accuse me...

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.680
for no reason.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.599
A violent battle...

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.079
between the Old City Gang and the Han Gang...

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.680
slowly started intensifying two weeks ago.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.799
There is information that in this case,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.199
Han Gang became seriously injured and in a coma.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.319
Some believe that this was an assassination attempt.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.000
We interviewed the ex officio council member Huang Xiao...

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.199
to give his opinion on the recent incidents...

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.480
in Hokong.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.240
I urge all parties to remain calm.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.360
I also advise the police...

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.120
to take a lot of precautions...

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.880
during the investigation.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.759
The victim of this shooting...

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960
is 18-year-old Ma Shan Bao...

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.679
who came from a single-parent family in the Old City District.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.599
His father was also a member of the Old City Gang...

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.160
who was killed as well in a gang vendetta many years ago.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.040
The police have yet to find the killer.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.600
They won't rule out expanding the search further.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So far,

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.880
no one related to the case has been arrested.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.040
The police has repeatedly claimed...

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.840
that there is evidence to charge Ma Shan Bao with hit-and-run.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.400
May I ask what that evidence is?

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.679
The police don't just release...

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680
our files to the public.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.560
Ma Shan Bao had an alibi.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.240
You can't provide any evidence at all!

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.040
You're the defense attorney.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.759
Do you think we'll just show you...

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.880
our trump card?

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.879
If it's court evidence,

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880
you can't hide it.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.080
You have to disclose it.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.999
If we really have...

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.320
to go to court,

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680
it'll be disclosed...

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.000
according to the procedure.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800
As you know,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.639
because the police...

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.880
can't provide any evidence,

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.600
Ma Shan Bao became the scapegoat!

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.760
So the police must provide an explanation to me!

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.240
Ms. Zhou.

00:38:32.241 --> 00:38:33.320
Calm down.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.760
We're talking about a life here.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.240
You're not being calm, you're cold-blooded!

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.959
We've already mobilized the maximum level of police force...

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.080
to track down Ma Shan Bao's killer.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.680
Calm down first.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680
Madam.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.799
Judge Shen is here.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.800
She wants to see you.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960
Escort her out.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440
Yes, Madam.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.360
Ms. Zhou, it's useless to come here and pick a fight every day.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.760
Why don't you go to the Complaints Department?

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800
Don't worry.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120
I will.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.240
Judge Shen.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:32.960
You still recognize me?

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.039
When I just graduated from the Police Academy,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.200
you were the judge in a few of my cases.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.120
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.400
Two weeks ago, my car was stolen.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.920
My son-in-law reported it.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.920
Qin Yu.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.200
I believe you know him too.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.080
You once got injured trying to save him.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.720
I'm a cop.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800
That's my job.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.319
But the car was found...

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.440
a few hours later.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200
I'm sorry, Judge Shen.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.136
The case is still under investigation.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.840
I can't disclose anything about the case.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.560
Even if you don't say anything,

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.400
news have already spread like wildfire.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.240
Judge Shen, are you asking me to break the rules?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
You should know...

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.080
this rule better than I do.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.560
I used to be a judge.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.240
I know that some colleagues...

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.959
and even some judges...

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.400
received blackmail letters...

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.200
or their lives were even threatened.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.520
Of course an impartial judge like Qin Yu...

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.920
also experienced that.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.440
Maybe he's already being blackmailed...

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.640
as we speak.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680
A tragedy...

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.840
once happened in my family.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.520
I'm sure...

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.760
you also know that my daughter...

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.800
Judge Shen, I...

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.040
I mean,

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.360
I don't really know the reason.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.080
I don't know either.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.480
My daughter was a pharmacist.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.200
She wouldn't take medicine by mistake.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.040
And she was healthy.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.240
Her husband and son loved her so much.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.200
She wouldn't kill herself.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.199
She didn't even leave a suicide note.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.759
There was really no reason at all.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.680
I... I don't know anything.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.040
Qin Yu was my intern.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.160
That was how they met.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.999
When Lan Lan married him,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.480
it was just after her 20th birthday.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.400
And Qin Yu was already 30.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.280
I never really approved of it.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760
However,

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.640
when Wei Wei was born.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120
I knew...

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.720
he is the most precious gift...

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960
my daughter left...

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.320
to me.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Judge Shen.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.079
Was Qin Yu blackmailed?

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.319
Was he threatened?

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.000
Is it related to this case?

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600
Judge Shen.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.440
You just said it yourself.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.080
He's a judge.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.799
These things happen all the time.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.360
But you're a cop.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.959
You should investigate.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.199
How do you know I didn't?

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.520
Do you know Wei Wei?

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.280
We met last week.

00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:26.320
After the car theft?

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.160
Judge Shen, this is not a courtroom.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.840
If we were in a courtroom,

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.600
I could order you to answer me.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.800
But right now, I...

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.960
I'm begging you.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.360
I'm not a mighty judge anymore.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.520
I'm just a mother...

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.840
who lost her daughter.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520
A grandmother...

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.280
who wants to help her grandson.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.120
Please help me.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.760
- Mr. Qin. - Luo Wen.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.640
Come in.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.680
The police found...

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.360
an asthma inhaler at the scene.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.920
The DNA on the inhaler...

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.840
matches the other findings.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240
What does it match?

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.960
I don't know. It's not stated.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.696
But the important thing is that...

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.479
the inhaler and other findings...

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.799
don't match...

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800
Ma Shan Bao's DNA.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.280
Ma Shan Bao had nothing to do with the accident.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.519
Tang Xuan has long known about it,

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.520
Mr. Zhang too.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.800
But they didn't say anything.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.800
How did you get...

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040
this confidential file?

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.360
I noticed that this document...

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.800
was with Tang Xuan.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.440
Then Mr. Zhang had it.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
So I think...

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.800
this document must have something to do with Ma Shan Bao.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.919
Later on, while the police...

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.360
went out to take a call,

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.480
I secretly took a picture with my camera.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.520
Why don't you seem surprised at all?

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240
No.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.520
I'm still processing this.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.080
The police have yet to find the killer.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.720
They won't rule out expanding the search further.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.599
The victim of this shooting...

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.760
is 18-year-old Ma Shan Bao...

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.560
who came from a single-parent family in the Old City District.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.680
His father was also a member of the Old City Gang...

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.679
who was killed as well in a gang vendetta many years ago.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.960
The police have yet to find the killer.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.719
They won't rule out expanding the search further.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.839
But so far,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.760
no one has been arrested.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.280
I got him killed.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440
First of all,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.240
it was Ma Shan Bao's request...

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.280
to turn state's evidence.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.680
Your deal was that...

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.800
he'd provide information.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.760
And the prosecution agreed...

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.760
to escort him out of the country.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.800
But now, Ma Shan Bao is dead.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.760
And he was killed during your house arrest request.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200
In this regard,

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.400
the police can say...

00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:06.681
they are not responsible at all.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.880
Is it really my fault?

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.840
No...

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.600
You've already secured...

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.520
the best terms for your client.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.480
But sometimes, it's all about luck.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.360
If the timing isn't right,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.120
you can't do anything right.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.880
It's not your fault.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040
Currently,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.920
the main thing is that this piece of blood...

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.840
is pressing on Young Master Gang's nerves.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.679
Causing his hearing...

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680
and speech problems.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.280
But we'll do our best...

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.440
to help him recover as soon as possible.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.080
(Changing Room)

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.720
This is a hospital. How can you smoke here?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.320
Smoke outside if you want.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.920
- Okay, we'll smoke outside... - Let's go.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.160
- I'm sorry. - Have more self-awareness.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.120
- Smoking is bad for health. - I'm sorry.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Doctor.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.920
Did something happen?

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640
- Hey. - Xiao Gang.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.080
Xiao Gang.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.880
- Xiao Gang. - What's wrong?

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.400
Xiao Gang is awake.
