00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.710
(Episode 71)

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.810
What's the matter, Chairman?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.150
Who do you think I am?
How dare you serve me this?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.150
Darn it.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.790
This filth.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.460
You all can eat this trash!

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.790
You all can eat this trash!

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.700
Eat this trash!

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.730
- Eat this trash!
- Oh my!

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.070
You expect me to eat this trash?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.400
You vile creatures, eat it all!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.070
Eat it all!

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.410
What do you mean, trash?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.940
It's pan-fried beef, your favorite.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.850
My foot! It's not beef pancakes.
It's trash!

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.580
You rotten jerks!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.950
- You all can eat this trash!
- What's wrong, Father?

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.090
Who are you calling Father?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.090
Who are you people?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.760
Who are you to lock me up in here?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.330
Where am I?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.600
Where am I?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.840
- Chairman, please go inside. Go on.
- Where am I?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
Goodness.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560
They're trying to make me eat trash.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.990
Okay. Please calm down, Chairman.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.160
Those jerks. They all deserve to die.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.630
Who do they think
they're feeding trash to?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.600
You'll feel better
once you take the sedative.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.980
Who are you, by the way?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.120
Why are you here?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.820
- Aren't you going home?
- It's me, Manager Gong.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.590
Don't you recognize me?

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.060
I don't know. I'm sleepy.
I'm going to bed.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.830
Goodness.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.740
What is going on?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.310
Honey, try slapping me.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.050
What on earth is wrong with Father?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.220
Anyone can see that's dementia.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.520
Do you know anything about this?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.060
What would I know?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.420
What about you?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.900
- How would I know any different?
- But how could this happen so suddenly?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.560
How can a person change
like that overnight?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500
Dementia can come on just like that.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.600
Did you think it comes
with a movie trailer first?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.340
Dad has dementia?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.940
Nothing's for sure yet, so don't worry.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.140
How can you say that
after seeing him like this?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.950
Oh, right.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.920
After Father's brain surgery,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.550
they said dementia was a possibility.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.550
Oh, you're right.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.520
That's what Doctor Kim said.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.460
What are we going to do about Father?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.230
This is no small matter.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.430
It's already this bad. It must be serious.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.500
I know. It's only going to get worse.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.340
Has anything been unusual at home?
Any signs or anything?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.740
No, of course not.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.480
Otherwise, I would have said something.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.380
How has he been at the company?

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.350
He's been fine at the company too.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.590
He took a sedative and is sleeping.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.290
He's just stressed because of you guys.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.220
It's nothing serious, so don't fuss.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.490
You think a little stress causes dementia?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.900
Who said it's dementia? Watch your mouth!

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.730
Then why is he acting like that?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.930
Stop denying it. We must accept reality.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.570
We all saw him.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.710
Don't you dare discuss things unconfirmed.
They say you can speak things into being.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.840
You should all reflect on your actions.
Just think how bad things must be for him.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.150
All of you children are giving him grief.
Even I would lose my mind.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.250
Watch your mouths and make sure
not a word of this gets out of the house.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.060
Chairman will be fine,
so stop overreacting.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.430
No matter what,
I'll be the one to protect the chairman.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.840
Listen to the devoted wife.
Who is she to "protect" Father?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.700
She hasn't even been in our family
for that long.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.580
What if he becomes incontinent
and needs diapers and everything?

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.320
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.490
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.900
Something's wrong with my father.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.870
He's showing signs of dementia.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.680
We'll need a doctor's diagnosis, but...

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040
Dementia?

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.080
- It started last night.
- So suddenly? How is that possible?

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.090
So, what does this mean for the future?
Can he continue to serve as the chairman?

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.220
We'll have to wait and see.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.030
If it really is dementia,
the chairmanship will be vacant.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.100
Shouldn't we convene the board
and create an emergency system led by you?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.800
It's too soon for that.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.970
Besides,
he hasn't been officially diagnosed yet.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.800
Still, we need to prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.510
Better than wasting time now
only to panic later.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.150
Yes!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.420
So things are turning out like this?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.260
Okay, so if Chairman Min Doo Sik
has dementia,

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.390
then CEO Min will take over,

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.200
and if she eventually becomes
the chairwoman?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.870
This is the chance of a lifetime for me.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.570
- I said I'm going home!
- Chairman!

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.740
- Come on.
- Gosh.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.340
But this is your house, Father.
Where are you trying to go?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.410
Let go of me, you witch!

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.650
- This is driving me crazy!
- Darn it.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.480
I'm telling you, this is your house!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.050
Chairman!

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.720
Look, I have to go home.
This isn't my house, is it?

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.990
Please let me go home, ma'am.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.790
Ma'am?
Father, it's me, your daughter-in-law.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.830
Let go! I said I have to go home!

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.200
Ma'am, I'm telling you, I have to go home.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.000
Dad, what's wrong?
Where are you trying to go?

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.370
Please calm down.
This is your home, Chairman.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.010
I want to go home. Let me go home.
Send me home. Ma'am, please?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.710
Dad, I'm telling you, this is your house.
Snap out of it!

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.080
- Darn it.
- Chairman.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.920
I can't get through to him at all. Gosh!

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.280
- Please just let me go home.
- Dad.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.350
Hey, honey.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.720
How's Father doing?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.420
What do you think?
It's absolute chaos here.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.990
He packed up his clothes,

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.860
and now he's trying to run away from home.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.560
What did you say?

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.670
But why on earth is he doing that?
What's gotten into him?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.710
What's going on?

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.080
I have no idea! Why is he doing this?

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.320
He's completely lost his mind. My gosh.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.450
Oh my!

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.790
Honey, what's wrong?

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.090
My head!

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.530
Your father hit me.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.030
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.400
Why would he hit you on the head?
What if your empty head gets even emptier?

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.040
And what is that woman up to?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.340
Isn't she home?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.740
Can you believe she went out
at a time like this?

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.240
Is it that serious?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.940
It appears to be.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.980
Hiding his medical appointments
is suspicious enough,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.750
but wouldn't it be best to confirm
with his personal doctor?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.460
His doctor is a longtime friend of Min's,
and he's also indebted to him.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.460
So, he's not going to tell us the truth.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.290
Chairman Min likely told him
to keep quiet.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.200
Then what do we do?

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.370
If Min Doo Sik is really like this,
what happens to our plan?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.640
If it really is dementia,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.610
the entire plan falls apart.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.310
That's ridiculous!
After all we've done to get this far.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.280
You're saying it all ends for nothing?

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.350
If it's dementia,
we can't even get him to stand in court,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.250
and as he can't legally give his shares,
it'll be hard to bring down Mingang.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.360
That man really is my worst enemy.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.260
Dementia? Why now, of all times?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.030
You heard from Kyung Chae, right?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
Heard what?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.400
Come on.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.800
I should be asking you the same thing.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.340
You're not giving me any context.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.440
If, by some chance, Father steps down
as chairman because of dementia,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.910
you seem to think it'll be
Min Kyung Chae's world.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.710
That's where you're wrong.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.050
My brother and I won't just stand by
and let that happen.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.750
If we children divide Father's shares
and exercise our voting rights,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.390
it won't be easy for Kyung Chae
to become the chairwoman.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.060
On top of that,
my sister-in-law and her family...

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.530
will probably give their shares
to my brother.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.560
Things will get more complicated then.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.930
If you want to look at it that way,
the CEO has more friendly shares.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.740
You're well aware of which board members
are on the CEO's side,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.440
and on top of that, she has me.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.980
So, does that mean...

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.840
you'll stick with my sister
to the very end?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.510
I don't know what the chairman's
current condition is,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.750
but don't you think you're getting
way ahead of yourself?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.020
The CEO is beside herself with worry
over the chairman right now.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.630
And you expect me to believe that?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.690
Whether you believe it or not
is up to you,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.200
but that's a fact.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.410
I heard you haven't eaten all day.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.980
You need to eat.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.880
You can't take medicine
on an empty stomach.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.850
Just five spoonfuls. Please?

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.020
Then I won't ask you to eat anymore.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.950
Come on.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:25.860
I don't want to eat.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.840
Are you okay?

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.870
Dad, seriously, what's gotten into you?

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.210
I'm fine, so don't yell.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.240
You'll just startle him and make it worse.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.190
Could he really have dementia?

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.700
Slow down. You can even choke on water.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.170
What were you saying on the phone earlier?
What happened to your father-in-law?

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.940
I must have misheard you, right?
I mean, dementia...

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.440
It's not something that just happens
to anyone overnight.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.950
You heard me right.
Father-in-law has lost his mind.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.450
What in the world are you babbling about?

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.920
- So your father-in-law has dementia?
- That's what I'm saying.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.390
Chairman Min Doo Sik, the living legend
of the Korean distribution industry?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.760
I'm telling you, yes!

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.360
The man who started from scratch
and conquered the distribution industry?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.870
That's right!

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.440
My goodness, what a bolt out of the blue.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.710
Wait, so does this mean he'll never be
in his right mind again?

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.210
Pretty much.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.880
He called me "ma'am." Can you believe it?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.280
- He asked me to take him home.
- My goodness!

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.680
Soon, he'll be playing with his own poop
like it's clay.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.850
Wait, if your father-in-law has dementia,
who becomes the next chairman?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.090
Does your older sister-in-law
get to take over?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.560
Well, probably. It's not like my husband
is even in the running.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.770
He's just no help at all, is he?
What bad timing for him to lose it.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.300
Ji Seop was just reinstated,
and now he decides to lose it?

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.770
Good grief.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.890
You saw
the chairman's scans earlier, right?

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.500
He's been in that state since the surgery.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.370
So you're saying the dementia symptoms
are no coincidence?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.970
That's why I warned him...

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.470
to be careful.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.040
Then there's no room for doubt.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.310
Please issue a medical certificate.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.950
A medical certificate might be difficult,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.080
but I can write up my medical opinion.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.190
But is that really what's important
right now?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.820
The patient is what matters,
not some piece of paper...

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.260
It's important to us.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.260
The chairman isn't just anybody.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.430
With him collapsing so suddenly,
the family is extremely worried.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.270
Everyone needs to know
exactly what my father's condition is.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.170
And the company is bound to notice
the chairman's absence,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.970
so we need to be prepared, don't we?

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.880
They say karma is slow, but sure.
He's just getting what he deserves.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.380
If the chairman has dementia,

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.980
this isn't the justice I wanted.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.680
What have we been fighting for?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.150
To put Chairman Min Doo Sik on trial...

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.890
and make him face real consequences.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.720
For him to be declared legally incompetent
and escape legal punishment...

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.090
I don't want that either.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.100
There's definitely something else
going on here.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.400
It can't have progressed this quickly.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.270
You can never tell
what that man is thinking.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.370
What if, by some chance,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.810
he has some other motive?

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.010
Has anything happened recently...

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.650
that could have affected
Chairman Min Doo Sik's state of mind?

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.220
From what I've heard, he's been stewing
over his children lately, but that's all.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.620
Oh, wait!

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.290
Do you know how Min Kyung Chae
dealt with Min Soo Jung's birth mother?

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.330
Dealt with her?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.230
She had her thrown
into a lockdown nursing home,

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.000
no different than a mental asylum,
and left her there to die.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.870
According to Lucia,
Min Doo Sik was furious when he found out.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.500
Hold on. So then,

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.810
you're saying Chairman Min Doo Sik
is disappointed in Min Kyung Chae?

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.610
To see his eldest daughter's true colors,
the one who's most like him...

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.150
It's no wonder he's disappointed.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.630
That's how it is with parents.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.560
One moment, you're glad your child
takes after you,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.730
and then you're horrified
for the very same reason.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.400
Even a cold-blooded man
like Min Doo Sik...

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.270
is shocked to see his child's true colors.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.480
Then could he use this as an excuse
to hand the company to another child?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.710
Those aren't exactly
appealing options either.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.580
As you know, Min Soo Jung
wasn't his legal wife's daughter,

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.350
so it'd be hard for her to build support
within the company.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.420
And don't even get me started
on Min Ji Seop.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.290
Then whether he likes it or not,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.930
the only heir left is CEO Min Kyung Chae.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.300
What on earth is he planning?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.340
Chairman. You can't just starve yourself
all day.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.240
You'll waste away.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.380
Chairman, I know you can't think
or remember anything right now.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.650
But you can't just lose your grip
like this.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.230
Get out! How dare you come in here!

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.100
Even when you're not in your right mind,
why do you hate me so much?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.070
They say the person you hate the most
when you've lost your mind...

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.310
is the one you cherished the most
when you were sane.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.510
You rotten witch.
You'll be the death of your own father.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.780
You were always so proud
that I was the one most like you.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.290
I've handled business and people
just as you taught me.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.020
So why are you acting like this now?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.090
You told me to discard people
once they were no longer useful.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.560
Father, if you keep this up,
you'll no longer be of any use to me.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.100
And you know what happens after that,
don't you?

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.170
Stop it, can't you?
Even in his state, he can feel your hate.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.300
You should only say kind things to him
as it is.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.970
Aren't you the devoted one?

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.770
Well, I guess...

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.440
you need some justification to stay here,
don't you?

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.610
What did you just say?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.120
If you want to stay here as his caregiver,
you'd better work hard.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.160
I met with Doctor Kim today.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.990
He confirmed Father has dementia.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.330
And he said it's only going to get worse.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.100
How could he make a diagnosis like that...

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.230
without even seeing the patient?

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.700
Father secretly went to the hospital
not too long ago,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.770
and he had a brain scan
and was examined for dementia.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.740
This is the doctor's written opinion.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.840
So it's real.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.940
Then there's no denying it.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.750
Oh, my. What are we going to do?

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.750
So, all of you, watch your mouths.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.850
What happens in this house
stays in this house.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.520
You think we can just keep this quiet?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.290
People have a right to know.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.490
What, you want me to post it
on the company intranet?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.860
If so, the stock price will drop.
Will you take responsibility for that?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.270
How am I supposed to take responsibility
for that?

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.540
That's why I'm telling everyone
to keep their mouths shut.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.440
If anyone breathes a word of this,
I won't let them get away with it.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.580
But look at her now.
She's acting like she owns the place.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.360
The problem is Ms. Se Ri.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.860
She hasn't spoken to you lately, has she?

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.030
I have a feeling
Lucia is putting her up to it.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.710
Ja Kyung, come out here a minute.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.480
Are you going somewhere?

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.450
Just stepping out for a bit.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.120
What about Father?

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.090
- You're here, aren't you?
- You want me to watch Father?

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.660
Well, who else is there?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.400
Whatever it is, can it be that important?

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.500
Not when Father's in this condition.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.500
This isn't the time to be going out.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.570
It's urgent and important.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.710
Manager Gong will be back from the store,
and Se Ri is here too.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.710
What if he tries to run away
from home again like last time?

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.490
There. That should do it, right?

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.200
Gosh, you're ruining my whole look.
What is this?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.330
Do you have any idea how expensive
this outfit is?

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.540
Keep a close eye on your father.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.100
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:02.070
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.150
It suits you.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.250
Lawyer Kim, what brings you here?

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.620
I just had a feeling you'd be here.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.190
I guess we're on the same wavelength.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.590
It's true. The chairman has dementia.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.090
I confirmed it with his primary doctor.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.330
I see. That's good for us.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.800
You need to hurry
and take over as chairman.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.070
There are more than a few people
who will try to stand in your way.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.240
What do you mean?

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.210
I'm talking about the portrait that was
delivered to your office.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.480
You see,
I've seen it somewhere else before.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.750
Where did you see it?

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.520
In Stella Jang's room.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.650
In Madam Jang's room?

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.220
She denied it,
so there was no way to confirm,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.220
but I'm positive I saw it there.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.060
That's impossible.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.560
How could it have been there?

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.500
Honey, you won't believe the mess I'm in.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.000
What are you talking about?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.140
Lucia left me to look after Father
and went out.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.580
What?

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.810
Wait, she left Father with you?

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.610
What are you going to do
if he causes a scene again?

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.950
I'm so nervous.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.290
He's dead quiet for now.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.460
But who knows
when he'll have another episode?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.790
What about Manager Gong?

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.560
She's at the supermarket.
She said she'd be back soon, but is late.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.600
So, honey,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.430
you should hurry home.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.270
Can't you leave work early?

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.010
What's wrong, Father?

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.250
Oh, wait!
Father, hold on! What are you doing?

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.620
- What's gotten into you, Chairman?
- Gosh, help me!

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.250
Calm down! What's wrong?

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.590
- Dad, what's wrong now?
- Chairman!

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.390
- I want to go home.
- What's wrong with you, Chairman?

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:59.860
- Gosh, Chairman.
- Please let me go home.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.060
- Dad!
- What's wrong, sir?

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.700
- Wait! Goodness.
- I'm leaving. I'm going home.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.860
But this is your home, Chairman.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.530
(Mingang Distribution)

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.210
So, Lawyer Kim, you think...

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.610
that Madam Jang is a relative
of the victim?

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.050
It's just a hunch,
so I can't say for sure.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.280
That's why I told you to act confident
in front of Stella Jang for now.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.150
Because it seems she's hoping
that painting will rattle you.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.660
But why on earth?

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.090
Even if Madam Jang is tied to that person,
why would she do that to me?

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.200
But that's not what's important now.
Think about it carefully.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.370
The owner of that painting is Stella Jang,

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:48.210
the one who moved it was Moon Tae Kyung,
and the one closest to both of them is...

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.910
Jung Lucia.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.710
Basically, the three of them are one team.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.580
Assuming that's the case,

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.780
the chairman's recent illness
will be a godsend for you.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.750
What can a legally incompetent person do?
They have no legal standing.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.760
The generation shift you mentioned
will just happen that much faster.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.290
Once you're in the chairman's seat,
you can handle those three as you wish.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.830
In fact,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.500
if you become the chairman,

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.600
those three might just leave on their own.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.380
What are you all doing
in a room without its owner?

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:33.180
Flowers? At a time like this?

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.250
You sure seem relaxed.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.090
The chairman will be fine and come back,
so I have to maintain his room.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.190
If you have no business here,
you can all leave.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.920
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:09.920
Don't even ask.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.290
I almost threw out my back.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.490
I can't believe how strong he is!

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.230
Gosh, this is a disaster.
What are we going to do?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.100
You're going through so much trouble.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.370
Honey, does your father have to stay
at home?

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.070
What's that supposed to mean?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.140
I mean, can't we send him to a facility?
One of those places for dementia patients?

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.140
I'm telling you, this is killing me.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.510
Gosh.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:40.580
I want to go home. Please let me go home.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.160
Chairman, what's wrong?
Look at me. Do you know who I am?

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.290
Do you recognize me?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.330
I want to go home. Please?
I want to go to my house.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.500
Please let me go, ma'am.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.400
Chairman, please calm down
and pull yourself together.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.110
I said I want to go home.
Ma'am, please, just this once.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.160
Yes, Nurse Jung, it's me.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.830
I heard about Jo Pil Doo's accident.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.860
You must be so heartbroken.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.030
I'm sure he's in a better place.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.670
Thank you. I hope so.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.240
Actually, I was hoping I could ask
for a favor.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.740
I heard that Chairman Min Doo Sik
was diagnosed with dementia...

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.470
from his doctor there.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:39.380
Could you look into the details for me?

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.610
There's just something about it
that doesn't sit right with me.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.490
You said this back then, didn't you?

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.630
That if you were to become the chairman,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.800
you wanted me
to give you all of my shares.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.830
But I believe I mentioned
there was a condition?

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.670
That's right. That's how you make a deal.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.740
I'll side with you and get you everything.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.840
In return,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.780
on the day you become chairman,

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.550
- you will make me CEO.
- But at Mingang,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.720
we don't make anyone CEO
unless they're part of the family.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.590
Are you saying, Lawyer Kim...

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.700
You'd be getting both.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.700
A spouse...

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.830
and a loyal subordinate.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.070
No matter what it takes,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.740
- are you sure you can make me chairman?
- Of course.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.010
To do that,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.110
you can't keep the chairman at home.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.020
If I don't keep him at home?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.190
Send him to a nursing home.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.460
That's the only way you'll have a reason
to kick Lucia out of the house.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.230
If the chairman stays at home,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.960
that woman will use taking care of him
as an excuse to stick around.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.700
That's true.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.100
Why didn't I think of that?

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.700
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.980
We have to carry out our plan
without anyone knowing.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.480
Understood. Our plan.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.390
What if he tries to find the nursing home
where they can stash Min Doo Sik?

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.690
Once I become chairman
and get that woman, Lucia, out of there,

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.860
it'll be the perfect happy ending.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.030
While you're still lucid,
you should take the easy way out.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.930
That's the only way to escape
the tragic fate that awaits you.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.640
