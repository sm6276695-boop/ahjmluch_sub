WEBVTT

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:07.970
- Good job.
- Thank you.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.863
- Really, thank you.
- Yay!

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:10.963
- Yay!
- That was amazing.

00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:12.463
Thank you.

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:14.181
Azusa.

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:17.619
Thank you so much.

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:25.190
Sorry, let's go back to
being siblings for a while.

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:28.708
What?

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:50.535
Yamato. I'm not giving her to you.

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.432
Matsuri is mine.

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:56.847
You're quite on edge, Azusa.

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:59.428
You don't come across as an idol.

00:00:59.428 --> 00:01:02.712
Maybe that's why you're losing to Prism.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:09.541
And before you know it,
even your sister will be mine.

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.258
Maybe it's a matter of determination.
[1st - PRISM, 2nd - Terzetto]

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:16.334
The members of Prism are putting
everything on the line, their lives and careers.

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.377
Not like you guys.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:21.616
They've completely replaced you.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.237
Terzetto is finished.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.759
No way, Terzetto isn't done!

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.828
Don't say that.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.554
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:40.907
Mr. Kisaragi, the thing that we discussed
is still pending.

00:01:40.907 --> 00:01:42.960
I'll go ahead and explain.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.581
Listen, our agency has decided to host an award
that transcends agency boundaries.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:53.370
The Luminous Prize Award.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.603
Yes.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:59.896
The group that wins the award
will officially be Japan's best idol group.

00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:04.038
Of course, we'd like someone
from our side to win.

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:06.271
Terzetto will win.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:10.734
We're going to reclaim the top spot.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.984
Prism is a tough opponent.

00:02:13.687 --> 00:02:18.139
If you get angry easily and mess up,
that might make this win difficult.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.803
You're the coolest one of Terzetto.

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.150
- Matsuri.
- It won't open!

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:46.959
You didn't have to buy it.
I would've given it to you anyway.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.088
The moment we get to buy a new song
is so precious for a fan!

00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:55.662
It's a good song, right?

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:57.594
I quite like it too.

00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:04.429
I'll also do my best, and definitely win MVP!

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.320
Why do you want it so badly?

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:12.443
Well, I want to have you all to myself.

00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:19.283
And I definitely don't want to lose the battle
over the number one idol Terzetto.

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:21.968
Of course, I don't want to lose.

00:03:31.581 --> 00:03:33.688
I'm not holding back at all.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:36.749
But...

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:42.436
Am I really putting my all into being an idol
right now as if my life depended on it?

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.184
Good morning.

00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:42.285
Good morning.

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:43.678
Where are they?

00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:45.844
Haruka and the others are still sleeping.

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:48.399
Go wake them up immediately.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.454
And you, get ready to stay over
and get in the car.

00:04:52.454 --> 00:04:54.199
You're going to be their supporter.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.474
Huh?

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:59.096
You're going to stay with us
until the awards ceremony.

00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:16.215
Wow, is this where we're staying?

00:05:19.683 --> 00:05:23.136
Being isolated and locked away before debut.

00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:24.966
Oh?

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:27.852
Hi, long time no see.

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:38.873
Huh?

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.992
- Hey.
- You're late.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:44.492
Let's break a leg.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:46.107
Yes.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.225
Huh? We're staying with them? Ouch!

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:53.653
You should have told us earlier.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.604
What? We're staying with...

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:00.165
Listen up! Give it like your life depends on it!

00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:01.451
Yes, sir!

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:06.070
If you're an idol and truly want to
make your fans happy, crawl through hell.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.208
- Yes!
- There are plenty of replacements for you.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:12.479
Yes!

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:16.862
Terzetto.

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:17.975
Yes.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:20.247
Learn everything you can
from Prism with all your might.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.196
Yes.

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:23.631
- Prism.
- Yes.

00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.950
Don't go easy just because they're your seniors.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.097
Yes.

00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:34.412
Japan's best idol
is going to be either one of you.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:51.780
And three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
And now...

00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:19.116
Six, seven, eight...

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:25.803
No, no, that's not working at all.
Don't be so weak!

00:07:25.803 --> 00:07:27.516
- Azusa, put in more strength!
- Okay.

00:07:27.516 --> 00:07:29.479
Do you think your feelings
are getting through like that?

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.819
- No.
- Please let us try one more time.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.046
Please!

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:37.485
- Let's take it from the top.
- Yes, from the chorus.

00:07:46.513 --> 00:07:48.712
- Great job.
- Thank you.

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:51.920
- Great job.
- Thank you.

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.028
Azusa.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.200
- Ah, I'm so hungry!
- What's for dinner?

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.446
It's curry.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:21.832
Oh, I can't eat carrots!

00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:23.922
Don't be picky!

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:25.804
Where's Terzetto?

00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:27.756
They said they're working without a break.

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:30.011
They might faint at this rate.

00:08:35.817 --> 00:08:38.601
Should we make some sandwiches
and deliver them?

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:41.419
Sure.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.411
Seeing Terzetto like this
makes my heart ache and want to cry.

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:07.144
But at the same time,
it's just overwhelmingly painful.

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:13.323
Why did I end up getting dumped?

00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:16.518
Okay, stop, stop!

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:19.525
Something feels missing.

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.345
What could it be?

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:27.400
Shall we try adding something to the scene?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.075
Something like involving one of the audiences.

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:32.536
I like it!

00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:35.267
Let's approach them on the spot.

00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:38.715
- That part... right after Azusa's melody.
- Got it.

00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:40.853
- Can you do it?
- Yes!

00:09:40.853 --> 00:09:43.576
- Let's give it a try.
- Okay!

00:09:43.576 --> 00:09:46.722
You, help them out.

00:09:46.722 --> 00:09:47.970
Huh?

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:55.582
Act as an audience member
and let Azusa try to woo you.

00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:03.794
- Wait a second.
- You can't.

00:10:06.213 --> 00:10:08.029
Don't look away.

00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:10.969
Just keep your eyes on me.

00:10:13.772 --> 00:10:17.086
- Isn't that good?
- Yeah, it's great.

00:10:17.086 --> 00:10:19.643
- Alright, let's go with this!
- Okay.

00:10:19.643 --> 00:10:23.506
Matsuri, you don't need to be so conscious of it.

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:24.975
We're siblings, after all.

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:15.460
Time to get some fresh air!

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.029
Huh?

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:23.999
Wow, you've amazing board skills
even though you're famous.

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:26.076
- Thanks for lending me the board.
- Sure.

00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:28.318
Let's do this again.

00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:30.547
Say, want to come over for breakfast at my place?

00:11:31.192 --> 00:11:34.072
Ah, but...

00:11:35.926 --> 00:11:39.146
Hey, you're totally busted.

00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:41.898
Huh? Hold on for a second.

00:11:41.898 --> 00:11:44.873
My girlfriend is here, so see you later! Let's go.

00:11:44.873 --> 00:11:48.330
Hey, I told you not to call me a girlfriend,
come on!

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.403
- Huh, why not?
- Geez, come on.

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:56.622
What are you thinking, Yamato!

00:11:56.622 --> 00:12:00.553
- If any strange rumors start...
- I don't mind if they do.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.899
That's not good!

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:09.110
By the way, little sister,
you could be a little nicer, don't you think?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.341
What?

00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:13.424
Besides, like, you know...

00:12:13.424 --> 00:12:16.104
I went through a breakup.

00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:23.897
Sorry.

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.445
So naÃ¯ve of you.

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:32.966
That's it! Goodbye!

00:12:32.966 --> 00:12:35.373
Wait, I won't tease you anymore.

00:12:35.373 --> 00:12:37.328
You think I'll believe you? No way!

00:12:37.328 --> 00:12:40.290
You're a born liar.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.858
You deceive people
and use their weaknesses to blackmail!

00:12:43.858 --> 00:12:47.884
Wow, I'm really the worst, aren't I?

00:12:49.222 --> 00:12:51.656
But you know...

00:12:53.908 --> 00:13:01.675
you're the first one who has been so kind
to such a terrible person like me.

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:05.698
Yamato, you're way too close!

00:13:05.698 --> 00:13:07.380
Of course, I am.

00:13:10.783 --> 00:13:14.256
I'm trying to flirt with you right now.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.075
You're still too close!

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.864
It didn't work.

00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:29.501
Sorry, but I like Azusa.

00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:30.769
Oh.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:33.885
What?

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:39.915
Azusa! That's not what it looks like.

00:14:02.831 --> 00:14:04.711
Were you out jogging?

00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:05.904
Yeah.

00:14:05.904 --> 00:14:08.731
I've overdone the weight training,
my arms are so sore!

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:11.148
We just have to keep it up.

00:14:13.555 --> 00:14:16.141
How long are you going to sulk?

00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:17.992
What do you mean?

00:14:17.992 --> 00:14:20.082
Focus on your idol activities right now.

00:14:20.082 --> 00:14:21.793
Matsuri will be fine.

00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:23.379
No, it's not like that.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:28.798
You don't seem so confident
that Matsuri likes you.

00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:31.732
Well, I am sure.

00:14:31.732 --> 00:14:33.591
Matsuri prefers me in everything...
idol, brother, man.

00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:35.963
In all those ways, Matsuri values me the most.

00:14:35.963 --> 00:14:38.782
Huh? Actually, it's me that she prefers.

00:14:38.782 --> 00:14:40.108
I'm going ahead.

00:14:40.108 --> 00:14:41.688
Azusa.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.935
It's really okay.

00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:48.508
Don't panic.

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.483
Terzetto is amazing as always!

00:14:53.483 --> 00:14:55.455
Best of all!

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.144
I'm panicking.

00:14:59.144 --> 00:15:03.978
Matsuri believes we're the Number One idols.

00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:05.967
I want to live up to that belief.

00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:11.979
We understand that too, right?

00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:20.607
Not just now, but for the future as well,
I want her to feel like being with me.

00:15:20.607 --> 00:15:28.369
So, if I lose my composure and become overwhelmed,
it's not good for me.

00:15:29.113 --> 00:15:31.321
I understand.

00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:37.675
Both Rihito and I,
and I guess Matsuri do, too.

00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:40.668
Let's just keep trying our best.

00:16:08.974 --> 00:16:10.586
It's snowing.

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:20.861
What are you doing, Matsuri?

00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:28.137
I was wondering if I could make a snowman,
but I guess there's not enough snow for that.

00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:34.107
I thought a snowman might cheer everyone up a bit.

00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:37.624
Then how about a snowball fight
if we get enough snow?

00:16:40.748 --> 00:16:41.982
No way.

00:16:41.982 --> 00:16:43.880
It would be boring

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.505
- Bring it on.
- to have a snowball fight with you.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.878
Don't say it's boring.

00:16:48.878 --> 00:16:53.148
Because you never even hit me with a snowball.

00:16:53.148 --> 00:16:55.428
You always let me win.

00:16:55.428 --> 00:16:57.620
It's not my fault, dummy.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:03.045
I just couldn't hit you with cold snowballs,
no matter what.

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:05.498
Why's that?

00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:09.624
Because I thought of you as a treasure.

00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:22.607
I didn't really like who I was back then,
a crybaby and unreliable.

00:17:23.656 --> 00:17:29.163
But I'm sure I cherished you better than I do now.

00:17:33.626 --> 00:17:38.083
Matsuri, you'll catch a cold.

00:17:46.382 --> 00:17:50.254
I'll treasure you even more now.

00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:53.980
Subaru.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.406
What is it?

00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.375
No, it's nothing.

00:18:01.376 --> 00:18:02.925
Is it about Azusa?

00:18:08.648 --> 00:18:10.941
Matsuri, don't forget.

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:15.244
You're the most important girl in the world.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.784
Now don't let yourself get too cold.

00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:29.491
Thank you.

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:39.104
Oh no!

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:56.551
Ah, I'm so tired and hungry.

00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:59.070
Matsuri, we're done!

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.226
Huh? Matsuri?

00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:06.117
She's not here.

00:19:06.117 --> 00:19:08.206
Did she go shopping?

00:19:08.206 --> 00:19:10.974
Well, maybe I'll take a bath first.

00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:12.601
Maybe.

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:20.549
What?

00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:41.745
My hands are numb.

00:19:46.112 --> 00:19:48.037
What the heck are you doing?

00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:50.546
Azusa!

00:19:50.546 --> 00:19:52.665
Just come back inside.

00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:55.082
- I can't.
- What?

00:19:56.438 --> 00:19:59.811
If it snows again, I'll never be able to find it.

00:19:59.811 --> 00:20:01.572
Find what?

00:20:01.572 --> 00:20:03.266
The bracelet!

00:20:03.913 --> 00:20:06.788
It's the first thing you gave me.

00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:09.352
- Oh, that...
- It's...

00:20:09.352 --> 00:20:13.739
It's a charm to become someone worthy of you.

00:20:15.892 --> 00:20:19.132
I know you didn't give it to me
with that intention.

00:20:20.662 --> 00:20:29.732
But you know, you're so cool, and when
you're on stage, you become someone special.

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:37.296
So, the least I promise myself I'll do is
never lose when it comes to my feelings for you.

00:20:39.643 --> 00:20:40.981
What?

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:45.865
I'm not special.

00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:48.171
Sure, I'm an idol, but...

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:53.249
I'm just a regular high school guy.

00:20:56.858 --> 00:21:01.775
Matsuri,
I'm sorry for saying such mean things.

00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:17.315
You're cold. Matsuri, are you okay?

00:21:17.315 --> 00:21:19.446
Huh?

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:22.208
Matsuri, Matsuri!

00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:25.491
Are you okay?

00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:46.673
You'll feel warm soon, okay?

00:21:52.537 --> 00:21:53.835
I'm... sorry.

00:22:00.566 --> 00:22:02.374
I'm okay.

00:22:08.498 --> 00:22:10.072
I'm sorry.

00:22:12.513 --> 00:22:15.538
I caused trouble again.

00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:24.031
Matsuri, I promise.

00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:27.576
I won't hurt you again.

00:22:34.906 --> 00:22:37.080
W-Wait a moment.

00:22:43.284 --> 00:22:44.660
What're you...

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.979
I'll try not to look too much.

00:22:58.268 --> 00:23:02.077
Wait, Azusa.

00:23:08.727 --> 00:23:10.972
I'll warm you up.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.083
I'm going to take off the pants too.

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.140
Subaru, is the article's content true?
[Super popular idol Subaru has a scandal?]

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.354
- He's not this kind of person.
- From this moment,

00:23:55.354 --> 00:23:56.408
Be mine.
[The idols' affections are intensifying!]

00:23:56.408 --> 00:23:57.407
Don't worry.
[The idols' affections are intensifying!]

00:23:57.407 --> 00:23:59.700
Everyone is desperately trying
to keep a smile on their faces.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.747
I love you.

00:24:00.747 --> 00:24:04.755
Wasn't it Subaru that you have loved all along?
